(* This file containts the implementation of the tactics ``Decide
   Equality'' and ``Compare''. They can be used to decide the
   propositional equality of two objects that belongs to a small
   inductive datatype --i.e., an inductive set such that all the
   arguments of its constructors are non-functional sets.

   The procedure for proving (x,y:R){x=y}+{~x=y} can be scketched as
   follows:
   1. Eliminate x and then y.
   2. Try discrimination to solve those goals where x and y has
      been introduced by different constructors.
   3. If x and y have been introduced by the same constructor,
      then analyse one by one the correspoing pairs of arguments.
      If they are equal, rewrite one into the other. If they are
      not, derive a contradiction from the injectiveness of the
      constructor. 
   4. Once all the arguments have been rewritten, solve the left half 
      of the disjunction by reflexivity.
