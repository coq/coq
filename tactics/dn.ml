(* This file implements the basic structure of what Chet called
   ``discrimination nets''. If my understanding is right, it serves
   to associate actions (for example, tactics) with a priority to term
   patterns, so that if a hypothesis matches a pattern in the net,
   then the associated tactic is applied. Discrimination nets are used
   (only) to implement the tactics Auto, DHyp and Point.

   A discrimination net is a tries structure, that is, a tree structure 
   specially conceived for searching patterns, like for example strings
   --see the file Tlm.ml in the directory lib/util--. Here the tries
   structure are used for looking for term patterns.

   This module is then used in :
     - termdn.ml   (discrimination nets of terms);
     - btermdn.ml  (discrimination nets of terms with bounded depth,
                    used in the tactic auto);
     - nbtermdn.ml (named discrimination nets with bounded depth, used
                    in the tactics Dhyp and Point).
