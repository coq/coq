An intuitionistic first-order theorem prover -- JProver.

Usage:

Require JProver.
Jp [num].

Whem [num] is provided, proof is done automatically with
the multiplicity limit [num], otherwise no limit is forced
and JProver may not terminate.

Example:

Require JProver.
Coq < Goal (P:Prop) P->P.
1 subgoal

============================
 (P:Prop)P->P

Unnamed_thm < Jp 1.
Proof is built.
Subtree proved!

Description:
JProver is a theorem prover for first-order intuitionistic logic.
It is originally implemented by Stephan Schmitt and then integrated into
MetaPRL by Aleksey Nogin (see jall.ml). After this, Huang extracted the
necessary ML-codes from MetaPRL and then integrated it into Coq.
The MetaPRL URL is http://metaprl.org/. For more information on 
integrating JProver into interactive proof assistants, please refer to

Comments:
1. The original <jall.ml> is located in meta-prl/refiner/reflib of the
MetaPRL directory. Some parts of this file are modified by Huang.

2. <jtunify.ml> is also located in meta-prl/refiner/reflib with no modification.

3. <jlogic.ml> is modified from meta-prl/refiner/reflib/jlogic_sig.mlz.

4. <jterm.ml> and <opname.ml> are modified from the standard term module
of MetaPRL in meta-prl/refiner/term_std.

5. The Jp tactic currently cannot prove formula such as
   ((x:nat) (P x)) -> (EX y:nat| (P y)), which requires extra constants
in the domain when the left-All rule is applied.
