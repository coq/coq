			CoqIde Installation procedure.

CoqIde is a graphical interface to perform interactive proofs.
You should be able to do everything you do in coqtop inside CoqIde 
excepted dropping to the ML toplevel.

DISCLAIMER: CoqIde is ongoing work. Although it should never let you
	    loose a proof, you may encounter unexpected bugs.
 	    Do not hesitate to send suggestions/bug reports.

DISTRIBUTION PACKAGES

Your POSIX operating system may already contain precompiled packages
for Coq, including CoqIde, or a ready-to-compile... If the version
provided there suits you, follow the usual procedure for your
operating system.

E.g., on Debian GNU/Linux (or Debian GNU/k*BSD or ...), do:
   aptitude install coqide
On Gentoo GNU/Linux, do:
   USE=ide emerge sci-mathematics/coq

Else, read the rest of this document to compile your own CoqIde.

REQUIREMENT:
	- OCaml >= 3.07 with native threads support.
	- make world must succeed.
	- The graphical toolkit GTK+ 2.x. See http://www.gtk.org.
	  The official supported version is at least 2.8.x.
	  You may still compile CoqIde with older versions and 
          use all features.
	  Run 
		"pkg-config --modversion gtk+-2.0"
	  to check your version.
	  All recent distributions have precompiled packages.
	  Do not forget to install the developement headers packages.

	  On Debian, installing lablgtk2 (see below) will automatically
          install GTK+. (But "aptitude install libgtk2.0-dev" will
          install GTK+ 2.x should you need to force it for one reason
          or another.)

        - The OCaml bindings for for GTK+ 2.x, lablgtk2.

	  Your distribution may contain precompiled packages. For
          example, for Debian, run
                aptitude install liblablgtk2-ocaml-dev

          If it does not, see
          http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/lablgtk.html .

          The first official release of lablftk2 is here:
          http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/dist/lablgtk-2.10.0.tar.gz

          Note that even if its README requires ocaml > 3.07, it works
          ok with 3.07. If you are in a hurry just run :

              cd /tmp && \
              wget \
               http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/dist/lablgtk-2.10.0.tar.gz && \
              tar zxvf lablgtk-2.10.0.tar.gz && \
              cd lablgtk-2.10.0 && \
              ./configure && \
              make world && \
              make install

   	  You must have write access to the OCaml standard library path.

          If this fails, read lablgtk-2.10.0/README.


INSTALLATION
 0) For optimal performance, OCaml must support native threads (aka pthreads). 
    If this not the case, this means that Coq computations will be slow and 
    "make ide" will fail. Use "make bin/coqide.byte" instead. To fix this 
    problem, just recompile OCaml from source and configure OCaml with : 
	"./configure --with-pthreads". 
    In case you install over an existing copy of OCaml, you should better 
    empty the OCaml installation directory.

 1) Go into your Coq source directory and, as usual, configure with:

	./configure

    This should detect the ability of making CoqIde; check that is
    says it has detected this ability and activated the building of
    CoqIde.

    Then compile with

	make world

    and install with

	make install

    In case you are upgrading from an old version you may need to run
	make clean-ide

3) You may now run bin/coqide


NOTES
There are three configuration files located in your $(HOME) dir. 
 You may need to set HOME to some sensible value under Windows.

- .coqiderc is generated by coqide itself. It may be edited by hand or 
  by using the Preference menu from coqide. It will be generated the first time
  you save your the preferences in Coqide.

- .coqide-gtk2rc is a standard Gtk2 configuration file. A sample file can be
  found in the coq lib "ide" subdir.

- .coqide.keys is a standard Gtk2 accelerator dump. You may edit this file 
  to change the default shortcuts for the menus.

Read ide/FAQ for more informations.


TROUBLESHOOTING

  - Problem with automatic templates

    Some users may experiment problems with unwanted automatic
    templates while using Coqide. This is due to a change in the
    modifiers keys available through GTK. The straightest way to get
    rid of the problem is to edit by hand your .coqiderc (either
    /home/<user>/.coqiderc under Linux, or 
    C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\.coqiderc under Windows) 
    and replace any occurence of MOD4 by MOD1.
