\section*{The interpretation of Coq front abstract syntax of terms}

\ocwsection \label{interp}
This chapter describes the translation from \Coq\ context-dependent
front abstract syntax of terms (\verb=front=) to and from the
context-free, untyped, raw form of constructions (\verb=rawconstr=).

The modules translating back and forth the front abstract syntax are
organized as follows.
