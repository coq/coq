This version contains modifications by Lionel Elie Mamane
<lionel@mamane.lu> done while under employment of the Radboud
University Nijmegen. However, no copyright-assignment-to-employer
agreement was signed, and copyright of articles and books written on
work time rest with the employee. By analogy, it is Lionel's opinion
that copyright on these changes rests with him.

This product includes also software developed by
	Yves Bertot, Lemme, INRIA Sophia-Antipolis (contrib/interface,
parsing/search.ml)
	Pierre Crégut, France Telecom R & D (contrib/omega and contrib/romega)
	Pierre Courtieu, Lemme (contrib/funind)
	Loïc Pottier, Lemme, INRIA Sophia-Antipolis (contrib/fourier)
	Claudio Sacerdoti Coen, HELM, University of Bologna, (contrib/xml)

Coq includes a tactic Jp based on JProver, a theorem prover for
first-order intuitionistic logic.  Jprover was originally implemented
by Stephan Schmitt and then integrated into MetaPRL by Aleksey
Nogin. After this, Huang extracted the necessary ML-codes from MetaPRL
and then integrated it into Coq.
