\begin{flushleft}
  \em The status of \Program\ is experimental.
\end{flushleft}

We present here the new \Program\ tactic commands, used to build certified
\Coq\ programs, elaborating them from their algorithmic skeleton and a
rich specification \cite{Sozeau06}. It can be sought of as a dual of extraction
(see Chapter~\ref{Extraction}). The goal of \Program~is to program as in a regular
functional programming language whilst using as rich a specification as 
desired and proving that the code meets the specification using the whole \Coq{} proof
apparatus. This is done using a technique originating from the
``Predicate subtyping'' mechanism of \PVS \cite{Rushby98}, which generates type-checking
conditions while typing a term constrained to a particular type. 
Here we insert existential variables in the term, which must be filled
with proofs to get a complete \Coq\ term. \Program\ replaces the
\Program\ tactic by Catherine Parent \cite{Parent95b} which had a similar goal but is no longer
maintained.

The languages available as input are currently restricted to \Coq's term
language, but may be extended to \ocaml{}, \textsc{Haskell} and others
in the future. We use the same syntax as \Coq\ and permit to use implicit
arguments and the existing coercion mechanism.
Input terms and types are typed in an extended system (\Russell) and
interpreted into \Coq\ terms. The interpretation process may produce
some proof obligations which need to be resolved to create the final term.

\asection{Elaborating programs}
The main difference from \Coq\ is that an object in a type $T : \Set$
can be considered as an object of type $\{ x : T~|~P\}$ for any
wellformed $P : \Prop$. 
If we go from $T$ to the subset of $T$ verifying property $P$, we must
prove that the object under consideration verifies it. \Russell\ will
generate an obligation for every such coercion. In the other direction,
\Russell\ will automatically insert a projection.

Another distinction is the treatment of pattern-matching. Apart from the
following differences, it is equivalent to the standard {\tt match}
operation (see Section~\ref{Caseexpr}).
\begin{itemize}
\item Generation of equalities. A {\tt match} expression is always
  generalized by the corresponding equality. As an example,
  the expression: 

\begin{coq_example*}
  match x with
  | 0 => t
  | S n => u
  end.
\end{coq_example*}
will be first rewrote to:
\begin{coq_example*}
  (match x as y return (x = y -> _) with
  | 0 => fun H : x = 0 -> t
  | S n => fun H : x = S n -> u
  end) (refl_equal n).
\end{coq_example*}
  
  This permits to get the proper equalities in the context of proof
  obligations inside clauses, without which reasoning is very limited.

\item Generation of inequalities. If a pattern intersects with a
  previous one, an inequality is added in the context of the second
  branch. See for example the definition of {\tt div2} below, where the second
  branch is typed in a context where $\forall p, \_ <> S (S p)$.
  
\item Coercion. If the object being matched is coercible to an inductive
  type, the corresponding coercion will be automatically inserted. This also
  works with the previous mechanism.
\end{itemize}

If you do specify a {\tt return} or {\tt in} clause the typechecker will
fall back directly to \Coq's usual typing of dependent pattern-matching.


The next two commands are similar to their standard counterparts
Definition (see Section~\ref{Simpl-definitions}) and Fixpoint (see Section~\ref{Fixpoint}) in that
they define constants. However, they may require the user to prove some
goals to construct the final definitions.

\subsection{\tt Program Definition {\ident} := {\term}.
  \comindex{Program Definition}\label{ProgramDefinition}}

This command types the value {\term} in \Russell\ and generate proof
obligations. Once solved using the commands shown below, it binds the final
\Coq\ term to the name {\ident} in the environment.

\begin{ErrMsgs}
\item \errindex{{\ident} already exists}
\end{ErrMsgs}

\begin{Variants}
\item {\tt Program Definition {\ident} {\tt :}{\term$_1$} :=
    {\term$_2$}.}\\
  It interprets the type {\term$_1$}, potentially generating proof
  obligations to be resolved. Once done with them, we have a \Coq\ type
  {\term$_1'$}. It then checks that the type of the interpretation of
  {\term$_2$} is coercible to {\term$_1'$}, and registers {\ident} as
  being of type {\term$_1'$} once the set of obligations generated
  during the interpretation of {\term$_2$} and the aforementioned
  coercion derivation are solved.
\item {\tt Program Definition {\ident} {\binder$_1$}\ldots{\binder$_n$}
       {\tt :}\term$_1$ {\tt :=} {\term$_2$}.}\\
  This is equivalent to \\
   {\tt Program Definition\,{\ident}\,{\tt :\,forall}\,%
       {\binder$_1$}\ldots{\binder$_n$}{\tt ,}\,\term$_1$\,{\tt :=}}\,%
       {\tt fun}\,{\binder$_1$}\ldots{\binder$_n$}\,{\tt =>}\,{\term$_2$}\,%
       {\tt .}
\end{Variants}

\begin{ErrMsgs}
\item \errindex{In environment {\dots} the term: {\term$_2$} does not have type
    {\term$_1$}}.\\
    \texttt{Actually, it has type {\term$_3$}}.
\end{ErrMsgs}

\subsection{\tt Program Fixpoint {\ident} {\params} {\tt \{order\}} : type := \term
  \comindex{Program Fixpoint}
  \label{ProgramFixpoint}}

The structural fixpoint operator behaves just like the one of Coq
(see Section~\ref{Fixpoint}), except it may also generate obligations.
It works with mutually recursive definitions too.

\begin{coq_example}
Program Fixpoint div2 (n : nat) : { x : nat | n = 2 * x \/ n = 2 * x + 1 } :=
  match n with
  | S (S p) => S (div2 p)
  | _ => O
  end.
\end{coq_example}

Here we have one obligation for each branch (branches for \verb:0: and \verb:(S 0): are
automatically generated by the pattern-matching compilation algorithm):
\begin{coq_example}
  Obligations.
\end{coq_example}

You can use a well-founded order or a measure as termination orders using the syntax:
\begin{coq_eval}
Reset Initial.
Require Import Arith.
\end{coq_eval}
\begin{coq_example}
Definition id (n : nat) := n.

Program Fixpoint div2 (n : nat) {measure id n} : { x : nat | n = 2 * x \/ n = 2 * x + 1 } :=
  match n with
  | S (S p) => S (div2 p)
  | _ => O
  end.
\end{coq_example}

The \verb|measure| keyword expects a measure function into the naturals, whereas
\verb|wf| expects a relation.

\paragraph{Caution}
When defining structurally recursive functions, the
generated obligations should have the prototype of the currently defined functional
in their context. In this case, the obligations should be transparent
(e.g. using Defined) so that the guardedness condition on
recursive calls can be checked by the
kernel's type-checker. There is an optimization in the generation of
obligations which gets rid of the hypothesis corresponding to the
functionnal when it is not necessary, so that the obligation can be
declared opaque (e.g. using Qed). However, as soon as it appears in the
context, the proof of the obligation is \emph{required} to be declared transparent.

No such problems arise when using measures or well-founded recursion.

An important point about well-founded and measure-based functions is the following:
The recursive prototype of a function of type
{\binder$_1$}\ldots{\binder$_n$} \{ {\tt measure m \binder$_i$} \}:{\type$_1$}, 
inside the body is
\verb|{|{\binder$_i'$ \verb$|$ {\tt m} $x_i'$ < {\tt m} $x_i$}\verb|}|\ldots{\binder$_n$},{\type$_1$}. 
So any arguments appearing before the recursive one are ignored for the
recursive calls, hence they are constant.

\subsection{\tt Program Lemma {\ident} : type.
  \comindex{Program Lemma}
  \label{ProgramLemma}}

The \Russell\ language can also be used to type statements of logical
properties. It will generate obligations, try to solve them
automatically and fail if some unsolved obligations remain. 
In this case, one can first define the lemma's
statement using {\tt Program Definition} and use it as the goal afterwards.
Otherwise the proof will be started with the elobarted version as a goal.
The {\tt Program} prefix can similarly be used as a prefix for {\tt Variable}, {\tt
  Hypothesis}, {\tt Axiom} etc...

\subsection{Solving obligations}
The following commands are available to manipulate obligations. The
optional identifier is used when multiple functions have unsolved
obligations (e.g. when defining mutually recursive blocks). The optional
tactic is replaced by the default one if not specified.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt Obligations Tactic := \tacexpr} Sets the default obligation
  solving tactic applied to all obligations automatically, whether to
  solve them or when starting to prove one, e.g. using {\tt Next}.
\item {\tt Obligations [of \ident]} Displays all remaining
  obligations.
\item {\tt Next Obligation [of \ident]} Start the proof of the next
  unsolved obligation.
\item {\tt Obligation num [of \ident]} Start the proof of
  obligation {\tt num}.
\item {\tt Solve Obligations [of \ident] [using \tacexpr]} Tries to solve
  each obligation of \ident using the given tactic or the default one.
\item {\tt Solve All Obligations [using \tacexpr]} Tries to solve
  each obligation of every program using the given tactic or the default
  one (useful for mutually recursive definitions).
\item {\tt Admit Obligations [of \ident]} Admits all
  obligations (does not work with structurally recursive programs).
\end{itemize}

The module {\tt Coq.Program.Tactics} defines the default tactic for solving
obligations called {\tt program\_simpl}. Importing 
{\tt Coq.Program.Program} also adds some useful notations, as documented in the file itself.

\section{Frequently Asked Questions
  \comindex{Program FAQ}
  \label{ProgramFAQ}}

\begin{itemize}
\item {Ill-formed recursive definitions}
  This error can happen when one tries to define a
  function by structural recursion on a subset object, which means the Coq
  function looks like:
  
  \verb$Program Fixpoint f (x : A | P) := match x with A b => f b end.$
  
  Supposing $b : A$, the argument at the recursive call to f is not a
  direct subterm of x as b is wrapped inside an exist constructor to build
  an object of type \verb${x : A | P}$.  Hence the definition is rejected
  by the guardedness condition checker. However you can do
  wellfounded recursion on subset objects like this:
  
\begin{verbatim}
Program Fixpoint f (x : A | P) { measure size } :=
  match x with A b => f b end.
\end{verbatim}
  
  You will then just have to prove that the measure decreases at each recursive
  call. There are three drawbacks though: 
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item You have to define size yourself;
  \item The reduction is a little more involved, although it works
    using lazy evaluation;
  \item Mutual recursion isn't possible anymore. What would it mean ?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
