\chapter*{Presentation of the Addendum}

Here you will find several pieces of additional documentation for the
\Coq\ Reference Manual. Each of this chapters is concentrated on a
particular topic, that should interest only a fraction of the \Coq\
users: that's the reason why they are apart from the Reference
Manual.
