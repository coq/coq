  We present a functional implementation of Koda and Ruskey's
  algorithm for generating all ideals of a forest poset as a Gray
  code. Using a continuation-based approach, we give an extremely
  concise formulation of the algorithm's core. Then, in a number of
  steps, we derive a first-order version whose efficiency is
  comparable to a C implementation given by Knuth.}

  ABSTRACT = { 
  We address the problem of combining individual decision procedures
  into a single decision procedure.  Our combination approach is based
  on using the canonizer obtained from Shostak's combination algorithm
  for equality.  We illustrate our approach with a combination
  algorithm for equality, disequality, arithmetic inequality, and
  propositional logic.  Unlike the Nelson--Oppen combination where the
  processing of equalities is distributed across different closed
  decision procedures, our combination involves the centralized
  processing of equalities in a single procedure.  The termination
  argument for the combination is based on that for Shostak's
  algorithm.  We also give soundness and completeness arguments.}

  We present the design and implementation of the new version of the

  completely independent of the rest of the system and has been
  rewritten in a purely functional way. This leads to greater clarity
  and safety, without compromising efficiency. It also opens the way to
  the ``bootstrap'' of the Coq system, where the kernel will be
  certified using Coq itself.}

  Hash consing is a technique to share values that are structurally
  equal. Beyond the obvious advantage of saving memory blocks, hash
  consing may also be used to gain speed in several operations (like
  equality test) and data structures (like sets or maps) when sharing is
  maximal. However, physical adresses cannot be used directly for this
  purpose when the garbage collector is likely to move blocks
  underneath. We present an easy solution in such a framework, with
  many practical benefits.}

  ABSTRACT = {We study the problem of certifying programs combining imperative and
  functional features within the general framework of type theory.
  
  Type theory constitutes a powerful specification language, which is
  naturally suited for the proof of purely functional programs. To
  deal with imperative programs, we propose a logical interpretation
  of an annotated program as a partial proof of its specification. The
  construction of the corresponding partial proof term is based on a
  static analysis of the effects of the program, and on the use of
  monads. The usual notion of monads is refined in order to account
  for the notion of effect. The missing subterms in the partial proof
  term are seen as proof obligations, whose actual proofs are left to
  the user. We show that the validity of those proof obligations
  implies the total correctness of the program.
  We also establish a result of partial completeness.
  
  This work has been implemented in the Coq proof assistant.
  It appears as a tactic taking an annotated program as argument and
  generating a set of proof obligations. Several nontrivial
  algorithms have been certified using this tactic.}

  URL = {http://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/ftp/publis/find.ps.gz},
  ABSTRACT = {In 1971, C.~A.~R.~Hoare gave the proof of correctness and termination of a
  rather complex algorithm, in a paper entitled \emph{Proof of a
    program: Find}. It is a hand-made proof, where the
  program is given together with its formal specification and where
  each step is fully 
  justified by a mathematical reasoning.  We present here a formal
  proof of the same program in the system Coq, using the
  recent tactic of the system developed to establishing the total
  correctness of 
  imperative programs. We follow Hoare's paper as close as
  possible, keeping the same program and the same specification. We
  show that we get exactly the same proof obligations, which are
  proved in a straightforward way, following the original paper.
  We also explain how more informal reasonings of Hoare's proof are
  formalized in the system Coq.
  This demonstrates the adequacy of the system Coq in the
  process of certifying imperative programs.}

  ABSTRACT = {Monads were introduced in computer science to express the semantics
  of programs with computational effects, while type and effect
  inference was introduced to mark out those effects.
  In this article, we propose a combination of the notions of effects
  and monads, where the monadic operators are parameterized by effects.
  We establish some relationships between those generalized monads and
  the classical ones.
  Then we use a generalized monad to translate imperative programs
  into purely functional ones. We establish the correctness of that
  translation. This work has been put into practice in the Coq proof
  assistant to establish the correctness of imperative programs.}

  ABSTRACT = {Nous étudions le problème de la certification de programmes mêlant
  traits impératifs et fonctionnels dans le cadre de la théorie des
  types.

  La théorie des types constitue un puissant langage de spécification,
  naturellement adapté à la preuve de programmes purement
  fonctionnels.  Pour y certifier également des programmes impératifs,
  nous commençons par exprimer leur sémantique de manière purement
  fonctionnelle. Cette traduction repose sur une analyse statique des
  effets de bord des programmes, et sur l'utilisation de la notion de
  monade, notion que nous raffinons en l'associant à la notion d'effet
  de manière générale.  Nous montrons que cette traduction est
  sémantiquement correcte.

  Puis, à partir d'un programme annoté, nous construisons une preuve
  de sa spécification, traduite de manière fonctionnelle. Cette preuve
  est bâtie sur la traduction fonctionnelle précédemment
  introduite. Elle est presque toujours incomplète, les parties
  manquantes étant autant d'obligations de preuve qui seront laissées
  à la charge de l'utilisateur.  Nous montrons que la validité de ces
  obligations entraîne la correction totale du programme.

  Nous avons implanté notre travail dans l'assistant de preuve
  Coq, avec lequel il est dès à présent distribué. Cette
  implantation se présente sous la forme d'une tactique prenant en
  argument un programme annoté et engendrant les obligations de
  preuve.  Plusieurs algorithmes non triviaux ont été certifiés à
  l'aide de cet outil (Find, Quicksort, Heapsort, algorithme de
  Knuth-Morris-Pratt).}

  part of the implementation of {\tt grep}-like programs. This
  functional program is obtained by the automatic method of {\em
  extraction} which removes the logical parts of the proof to keep only
