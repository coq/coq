                           The Coq documentation
                           =====================

The Coq documentation includes 

- A Reference Manual
- A Tutorial
- A document presenting the Coq standard library
- A list of questions/answers in the FAQ style

The sources of the documents are mainly made of LaTeX code from which
user-readable PostScript or PDF files, or a user-browsable bunch of
html files are generated.

Prerequisite
------------

To produce the documents, you need the coqtop, coq-tex, coqdoc and
gallina tools, with same version number as the current
documentation. These four tools normally come with any basic Coq
installation.

In addition, to produce the PostScript documents, the following tools
are needed:

  - latex (latex2e)
  - dvips
  - bibtex
  - makeindex
  - pngtopnm and pnmtops (for the Reference Manual and the FAQ)

To produce the PDF documents, the following tools are needed:

  - pdflatex
  - bibtex

To produce the html documents, the following tools are needed:

  - hevea (e.g. 1.07 works)

To produce the documentation of the standard library, a source copy of
the coq distribution is needed.
