(** This file provides classical logic and unique choice; this is
    weaker than providing iota operator and classical logic as the
    definite descriptions provided by the axiom of unique choice can
    be used only in a propositional context (especially, they cannot
    be used to build functions outside the scope of a theorem proof) *)

(** Classical logic and unique choice, as shown in
    [ChicliPottierSimpson02], implies the double-negation of
    excluded-middle in [Set], hence it implies a strongly classical
    world. Especially it conflicts with the impredicativity of [Set].
