(** These are the notations whose level and associativity are imposed by Coq *)

(** Notations for propositional connectives *)

Reserved Notation "x = y = z"
(at level 70, no associativity, y at next level).

Reserved Notation "x <> y  :>  T"
(at level 70, y at next level, no associativity).

(** Notations for pairs *)

Reserved Notation "( x , y , .. , z )" (at level 0).

(** Notation "{ x }" is reserved and has a special status as component
    of other notations such as "{ A } + { B }" and "A + { B }" (which
    are at the same level than "x + y");
    "{ x }" is at level 0 to factor with "{ x : A | P }" *)
