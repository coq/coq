(* The tactic solve_relation_wd is not very efficient because qsetoid_rewrite
uses qiff to take the formula apart in order to make it quantifier-free,
and then qiff is called again and takes the formula apart for the second
time. It is better to analyze the formula once and generalize qiff to take
a list of equalities that it has to rewrite. *)

relating to well-defidedness that are produced by applying induction.

example, supply additional arguments, as does NZinduct_center in
NZBase.v *)
