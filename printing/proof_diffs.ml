Displays the differences between successive proof steps in coqtop and CoqIDE.
Proof General requires minor changes to make the diffs visible, but this code
shouldn't break the existing version of PG.  See pp_diff.ml for details on how
the diff works.

Diffs are computed for the hypotheses and conclusion of each goal in the new
proof with its matching goal in the old proof.

Diffs can be enabled in coqtop with 'Set Diffs "on"|"off"|"removed"' or
'-diffs on|off|removed' on the OS command line.  In CoqIDE, they can be enabled
from the View menu.  The "on" option shows only the new item with added text,
while "removed" shows each modified item twice--once with the old value showing
removed text and once with the new value showing added text.

In CoqIDE, colors and highlights can be set in the Edit/Preferences/Tags panel.
For coqtop, these can be set through the COQ_COLORS environment variable.

Limitations/Possible enhancements:

- coqtop colors were chosen for white text on a black background.  They're
not the greatest.  I didn't want to change the existing green highlight.
Suggestions welcome.

- coqtop underlines removed text because (per Wikipedia) the ANSI escape code
for strikeout is not commonly supported (it didn't work on my system).  CoqIDE
uses strikeout on removed text.

(*** Code to determine which calls to compare between the old and new proofs ***)

(* Compare the old and new proof trees to identify the correspondence between
new and old goals.  Returns a map from the new evar name to the old,
e.g. "Goal2" -> "Goal1".  Assumes that proof steps only rewrite CEvar nodes
and that CEvar nodes cannot contain other CEvar nodes.

The comparison works this way:
1. Traverse the old and new trees together (ogname = "", ot != nt):
- if the old and new trees both have CEvar nodes, add an entry to the map from
  the new evar name to the old evar name.  (Position of goals is preserved but
  evar names may not be--see below.)
- if the old tree has a CEvar node and the new tree has a different type of node,
  we've found a changed goal.  Set ogname to the evar name of the old goal and
  go to step 2.
- any other mismatch violates the assumptions, raise an exception
2. Traverse the new tree from the point of the difference (ogname <> "", ot = nt).
- if the node is a CEvar, generate a map entry from the new evar name to ogname.

Goal ids for unchanged goals appear to be preserved across proof steps.
However, the evar name associated with a goal id may change in a proof step
even if that goal is not changed by the tactic.  You can see this by enabling
the call to db_goal_map and entering the following:

  Parameter P : nat -> Prop.
  Goal (P 1 /\ P 2 /\ P 3) /\ P 4.
  split.
  Show Proof.
  split.
  Show Proof.

  Which gives you this summarized output:

  > split.
  New Goals: 3 -> Goal  4 -> Goal0              <--- goal 4 is "Goal0"
  Old Goals: 1 -> Goal
  Goal map: 3 -> 1  4 -> 1
  > Show Proof.
  (conj ?Goal ?Goal0)                           <--- goal 4 is the rightmost goal in the proof
  > split.
  New Goals: 6 -> Goal0  7 -> Goal1  4 -> Goal  <--- goal 4 is now "Goal"
  Old Goals: 3 -> Goal  4 -> Goal0
  Goal map: 6 -> 3  7 -> 3
  > Show Proof.
  (conj (conj ?Goal0 ?Goal1) ?Goal)             <--- goal 4 is still the rightmost goal in the proof

(* Create a map from new goals to old goals for proof diff.  The map only
 has entries for new goals that are not the same as the corresponding old
 goal; there are no entries for unchanged goals.

 It proceeds as follows:
 1. Find the goal ids that were removed from the old proof and that were
 added in the new proof.  If the same goal id is present in both proofs
 then conclude the goal is unchanged (assumption).

 2. The code assumes that proof changes only take the form of replacing
 one or more goal symbols (CEvars) with new terms.  Therefore:
 - if there are no removals, the proofs are the same.
 - if there are removals but no additions, then there are no new goals
   that aren't the same as their associated old goals.  For the both of
   these cases, the map is empty because there are no new goals that differ
   from their old goals
 - if there is only one removal, then any added goals should be mapped to
   the removed goal.
 - if there are more than 2 removals and more than one addition, call
   match_goals to get a map between old and new evar names, then use this
   to create the map from new goal ids to old goal ids for the differing goals.
