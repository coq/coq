Set Universe Polymorphism.

(** Check that variance subtyping is respected. The signature T is asking for
    covariance, while M provide an irrelevant implementation, which is deemed
    legit.

    There is currently no way to go the other way around, so it's not possible
    to generate a counter-example that should fail with the wrong subtyping.
