(* History of the dealing of evars in specialize:

- Previously it was leaving w as an unresolved evar, producing the hypothesis

    IHn : load_bytes (unchecked_store_bytes ?w) -> True

   The correct behaviour should probably to requantify on w as

    IHn : forall w, load_bytes (unchecked_store_bytes w) -> True

- After #17322 (and before #18341) this was failing with

    In environment
    IHn : forall (m' : mem) (w : tuple), unchecked_store_bytes w = m' -> load_bytes m' -> True
    m' : mem
    w : tuple
    Unable to unify "?t" with "w" (cannot instantiate "?t" because "w" is not in its scope:
    available arguments are "IHn").

- After #18341 (fixing #18332) the old behaviour (leaving an unsolved evar) came back.
