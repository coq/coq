Recursive Extraction A.

Error:
The informative inductive type sig2 has a Prop instance
in A.eq_sig2_rec_uncurried (or in its mutual block).
This happens when a sort-polymorphic singleton inductive type
has logical parameters, such as (I,I) : (True * True) : Prop.
The Ocaml extraction cannot handle this situation yet.
Instead, use a sort-monomorphic type such as (True /\ True)
or extract to Haskell.
