      have (div2 (double (S m))= div2 (S (S (double m)))).
           ~= (S (div2 (double m))).

        = double (div2 n) * double (div2 n))
        by double_mult_l,double_mult_r.

Lemma even_double_n: (forall m, even (double m)).
proof.

          by main_thm_aux.
          ~= (double (p*p)) by H0.

Theorem irrationnal_sqrt_2: irrational (sqrt (INR 2%nat)).
proof.
  let p:Z,q:nat be such that H:(q<>0%nat)
                         and H0:(sqrt (INR 2%nat)=(IZR p/INR q)).

    ~=  ((IZR p/INR q)*(IZR p/INR q)*(INR q*INR q)) using ring.
    ~=  (sqrt (INR 2%nat) * sqrt (INR 2%nat)*(INR q*INR q)) by H0.
    ~= (INR (2%nat * (q*q)))  by sqrt2,mult_INR.
  then  (Z.abs_nat p * Z.abs_nat p = 2* (q * q))%nat.
    ~= ((q*q)+(q*q))%nat.
    ~= (Div2.double (q*q)).
  then (q=0%nat) by main_theorem.
  hence thesis by H.
