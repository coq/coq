# Coq Test Suite

The test suite can be run from the Coq root directory by `make test-suite`.
However, for incremental test suite builds, we recommend running `make`
from the test-suite directory (or with `make -C test-suite`).
This Makefile is compatible with both Dune
and legacy hybrid builds.

You can also run `make aaa/bbb/ccc.v.log` to build the log for one test,
or `make ddd` where `ddd` is on of the sub-directories of `test-suite`
to just build the logs for that directory.
In these cases, a summary is not printed, but can be generated by `make summary`.

`make -B` can be used to rerun tests ( -B meaning always remake).

From the `test-suite` directory, `make report` (included in `make
all`) prints a summary of which tests failed using the produced log
files (this still works when only some tests are built as described
above). Setting the `PRINT_LOGS` variable will make it print the logs
of the failing tests.

For instance, running the following in the `test-suite` directory:

```bash
$ echo Fail. > success/fail.v # make some failing test

$ make
TEST      prerequisite/make_local.v
...
TEST      success/fail.v
...

## Adding a test

Regression tests for closed bugs should be added to
[`bugs`](bugs), as `bug_1234.v` where `1234` is the bug number.
Files in this directory are tested for successful compilation.
When you fix a bug, you should usually add a regression test here as well.

The error "(bug seems to be opened, please check)" when running
`make test-suite` means that a test in [`bugs`](bugs) failed to
compile.

There are also output tests in [`output`](output) which consist of a `.v` file
and a `.out` file with the expected output.  Output tests in this directory are
run with coqc in -test-mode.  Output tests in [`output-coqtop`](output-coqtop)
work the same way, but are run with coqtop.

There are unit tests of OCaml code in [`unit-tests`](unit-tests). These tests
are contained in `.ml` files, and rely on the `OUnit` unit-test framework, as
described at <http://ounit.forge.ocamlcore.org/>.  Use `make unit-tests` in the
[`unit-tests`](unit-tests) directory to run them.

## Fixing output tests

When an output test `output/foo.v` fails, the output is stored in
`output/foo.out.real`. Move that file to the reference file
`output/foo.out` to update the test, approving the new output. Target
`approve-output` will do this for all failing output tests
automatically.

Don't forget to check the updated `.out` files into git!

Note that `output/MExtraction.out` is special: it is copied from
[`micromega/micromega.ml`](../plugins/micromega/micromega.ml) in the plugin
source directory. Automatic approval will incorrectly update the copy.

## Environment variables [draft/ongoing work]

For miscellaneous scripts part of the test suite, it is natural that
they need to access different binaries and files. As of today, the
handling of those has been done a bit in an ad-hoc way, but the below
guidelines should be implemented.

### Initial environment

- All scripts in the test suite will be called with the following in PATH:
  + a working OCaml toolchain + `ocamlfind` / `OCAMLPATH` properly set
  + a working Coq installation, with binaries and libraries

- Some scripts need to access additional files, for example the timing
  tests, to that purpose, we provide the following variables:
  + `COQ_TS_CORELIB`: absolute path where `lib/coq-core` lives
  + `COQ_TS_COQLIB`: absolute path where `lib/coq` lives

  [note: these variables are not yet implemented]

### TODO

- Main TODO stems from the fact that regular `make test-suite` won't
  setup the right initial environment due to make limitations. `make
  -f Makefile.dune test-suite` does setup it properly.
