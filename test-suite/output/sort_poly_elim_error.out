the return type has sort "Type" while it should be SProp or Prop.
Elimination of an inductive object of sort Prop
is not allowed on a predicate in sort "Type"
because proofs can be eliminated only to build proofs.

The command has indeed failed with message:
Incorrect elimination of "x" in the inductive type "sBox@{s s' | u}":
the return type has sort "Type@{s | u}"
while it should be in sort quality s'.
Elimination of a sort polymorphic inductive object instantiated to a variable sort quality
is only allowed on a predicate in the same sort quality.

Elimination of an inductive object of sort SProp
is not allowed on a predicate in sort "Prop"
because strict proofs can be eliminated only to build strict proofs.
