the return type has sort "Type" while it should be SProp or Prop.
Elimination of an inductive object of sort Prop
is not allowed on a predicate in sort "Type"
because proofs can be eliminated only to build proofs.

Elimination of a sort polymorphic inductive object instantiated to a variable sort quality
is only allowed on a predicate in the same sort quality.
