(* An 'a document is a structure to hold and manipulate list of sentences.
   Sentences are equipped with an id = Stateid.t and can carry arbitrary
   data ('a).
   
   When added (push) to the document, a sentence has no id, it has
   be manually assigned just afterward or the sentence has to be removed
   (pop) before any other sentence can be pushed.
   This exception is useful since the process of assigning an id to
   a sentence may fail (parse error) and an error handler may want to annotate
   a script buffer with the error message.  This handler needs to find the
   sentence in question, and it is simpler if the sentence is in the document.
   Only the functions pop, find, fold_all and find_map can be called on a
   document with a tip that has no id (and assign_tip_id of course).
   
   The document can be focused (non recursively) to a zone.  After that
   some functions operate on the focused zone only.  When unfocused the
   context (the part of the document out of focus) is restored.
