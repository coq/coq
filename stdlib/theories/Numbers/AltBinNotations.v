(** * Alternative Binary Numeral Notations *)

(** Faster but less safe parsers and printers of [positive], [N], [Z]. *)

(** By default, literals in types [positive], [N], [Z] are parsed and
    printed via the [Numeral Notation] command, by conversion from/to
    the [Decimal.int] representation. When working with numbers with
    thousands of digits and more, conversion from/to [Decimal.int] can
    become significantly slow. If that becomes a problem for your
    development, this file provides some alternative [Numeral
    Notation] commands that use [Z] as bridge type. To enable these
    commands, just be sure to [Require] this file after other files
    defining numeral notations.

    Note: up to Coq 8.8, literals in types [positive], [N], [Z] were
    parsed and printed using a native ML library of arbitrary
    precision integers named bigint.ml. From 8.9, the default is to
    parse and print using a Coq library converting sequences of
    digits, hence reducing the amount of ML code to trust. But this
    method is slower. This file then gives access to the legacy
    method, trading efficiency against a larger ML trust base relying
    on bigint.ml. *)
