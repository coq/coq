   Moreover, negations may be in unfolded forms,
   and A or B may live in Type *)

(** Tactics for applying equivalences.

The following code provides tactics "apply -> t", "apply <- t",
"apply -> t in H" and "apply <- t in H". Here t is a term whose type
consists of nested dependent and nondependent products with an
equivalence A <-> B as the conclusion. The tactics with "->" in their
names apply A -> B while those with "<-" in the name apply B -> A. *)

(* The idea of the tactics is to first provide a term in the context
whose type is the implication (in one of the directions), and then
apply it. The first idea is to produce a statement "forall ..., A ->
B" (call this type T) and then do "assert (H : T)" for a fresh H.
Thus, T can be proved from the original equivalence and then used to
perform the application. However, currently in Ltac it is difficult
to produce such T from the original formula.

Therefore, we first pose the original equivalence as H. If the type of
H is a dependent product, we create an existential variable and apply
H to this variable. If the type of H has the form C -> D, then we do a
cut on C. Once we eliminate all products, we split (i.e., destruct)
the conjunction into two parts and apply the relevant one. *)

(** *** [inversion_sigma] *)
(** The built-in [inversion] will frequently leave equalities of

    otherwise simplifies, [inversion_sigma] is useful; it will replace
    the equality of pairs with a pair of equalities, one involving a
    term casted along the other.  This might also prove useful for
    writing a version of [inversion] / [dependent destruction] which
    does not lose information, i.e., does not turn a goal which is
    provable into one which requires axiom K / UIP.  *)
