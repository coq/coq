(** Results formulated with iff, used in FSetDecide.
    Negation are expanded since it is unclear whether setoid rewrite
    will always perform conversion. *)

(** We begin with lemmas that, when read from left to right,
    can be understood as ways to eliminate uses of [not]. *)

    We have four lemmas that, when read from left to right,
    describe how to push negations toward the leaves of a

    how to pull negations toward the top of a proposition. *)

    decidability of propositions. *)

(** [solve_decidable using lib] will solve goals about the
    decidability of a proposition, assisted by an auxiliary
    database of lemmas.  The database is intended to contain
    lemmas stating the decidability of base propositions,
    (e.g., the decidability of equality on a particular
    inductive type). *)
