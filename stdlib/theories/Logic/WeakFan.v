(** A constructive proof of a non-standard version of the weak Fan Theorem
    in the formulation of which infinite paths are treated as
    predicates. The representation of paths as relations avoid the
    need for classical logic and unique choice. The idea of the proof
    comes from the proof of the weak KÃ¶nig's lemma from separation in
    second-order arithmetic [[Simpson99]].

    inductively_barred P (true::l) ->
    inductively_barred P (false::l) ->

(** [approx X l] says that [l] is a boolean representation of a prefix of [X] *)

Fixpoint approx X (l:list bool) :=

(** [barred P] means that for any infinite path represented as a predicate,
    the property [P] holds for some prefix of the path *)

Definition barred P :=

(** The proof proceeds by building a set [Y] of finite paths
   approximating either the smallest unbarred infinite path in [P], if
   there is one (taking [true]>[false]), or the path [true::true::...]
   if [P] happens to be inductively_barred *)
