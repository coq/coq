(** Diaconescu showed that the Axiom of Choice entails Excluded-Middle
   in topoi [[Diaconescu75]]. Lacas and Werner adapted the proof to show
   that the axiom of choice in equivalence classes entails
   Excluded-Middle in Type Theory [[LacasWerner99]].

   Three variants of Diaconescu's result in type theory are shown below.

   A. A proof that the relational form of the Axiom of Choice +
      Extensionality for Predicates entails Excluded-Middle (by Hugo
      Herbelin)

   B. A proof that the relational form of the Axiom of Choice + Proof
      Irrelevance entails Excluded-Middle for Equality Statements (by
      Benjamin Werner)

   C. A proof that extensional Hilbert epsilon's description operator
      entails excluded-middle (taken from Bell [[Bell93]])

   See also [[Carlström04]] for a discussion of the connection between the
   Extensional Axiom of Choice and Excluded-Middle
