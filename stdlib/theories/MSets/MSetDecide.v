(** First, a version for Weak Sets in functorial presentation *)

Module WDecideOn (E : DecidableType)(Import M : WSetsOn E).
 Module F := MSetFacts.WFactsOn E M.

(** * Overview
    This functor defines the tactic [fsetdec], which will
    solve any valid goal of the form
<<
    forall s1 ... sn,
    forall x1 ... xm,
    P1 -> ... -> Pk -> P
>>
    where [P]'s are defined by the grammar:
<<

P ::=
| Q
| Empty F
| Subset F F'
| Equal F F'

Q ::=
| E.eq X X'
| In X F
| Q /\ Q'
| Q \/ Q'
| Q -> Q'
| Q <-> Q'
| ~ Q
| True
| False

F ::=
| S
| empty
| singleton X
| add X F
| remove X F
| union F F'
| inter F F'
| diff F F'

X ::= x1 | ... | xm
S ::= s1 | ... | sn

>>

The tactic will also work on some goals that vary slightly from
the above form:
- The variables and hypotheses may be mixed in any order and may
  have already been introduced into the context.  Moreover,
  there may be additional, unrelated hypotheses mixed in (these
  will be ignored).
- A conjunction of hypotheses will be handled as easily as
  separate hypotheses, i.e., [P1 /\ P2 -> P] can be solved iff
  [P1 -> P2 -> P] can be solved.
- [fsetdec] should solve any goal if the MSet-related hypotheses
  are contradictory.
- [fsetdec] will first perform any necessary zeta and beta
  reductions and will invoke [subst] to eliminate any Coq
  equalities between finite sets or their elements.
- If [E.eq] is convertible with Coq's equality, it will not
  matter which one is used in the hypotheses or conclusion.
- The tactic can solve goals where the finite sets or set
  elements are expressed by Coq terms that are more complicated
  than variables.  However, non-local definitions are not
  expanded, and Coq equalities between non-variable terms are
  not used.  For example, this goal will be solved:
<<
    forall (f : t -> t),
    forall (g : elt -> elt),
    forall (s1 s2 : t),
    forall (x1 x2 : elt),
    Equal s1 (f s2) ->
    E.eq x1 (g (g x2)) ->
    In x1 s1 ->
    In (g (g x2)) (f s2)
>>
  This one will not be solved:
<<
    forall (f : t -> t),
    forall (g : elt -> elt),
    forall (s1 s2 : t),
    forall (x1 x2 : elt),
    Equal s1 (f s2) ->
    E.eq x1 (g x2) ->
    In x1 s1 ->
    g x2 = g (g x2) ->
    In (g (g x2)) (f s2)
>>

        have been defined using [autorewrite]. However, dealing
