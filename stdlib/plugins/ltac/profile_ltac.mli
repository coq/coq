(** Ltac profiling primitives *)

(* Note(JasonGross): Ltac semantics are a bit insane.  There isn't
   really a good notion of how many times a tactic has been "called",
   because tactics can be partially evaluated, and it's unclear
   whether the number of "calls" should be the number of times the
   body is fetched and unfolded, or the number of times the code is
   executed to a value, etc.  The logic in [Tacinterp.eval_tactic]
   gives a decent approximation, which I believe roughly corresponds
   to the number of times that the engine runs the tactic value which
   results from evaluating the tactic expression bound to the name
   we're considering.  However, this is a poor approximation of the
   time spent in the tactic; we want to consider time spent evaluating
   a tactic expression to a tactic value to be time spent in the
   expression, not just time spent in the caller of the expression.
   So we need to wrap some nodes in additional profiling calls which
   don't count towards to total call count.  Whether or not a call
   "counts" is indicated by the [count_call] boolean argument.

   Unfortunately, at present, we can get very strange call graphs when
   a named tactic expression never runs as a tactic value: if we have
   [Ltac t0 := t.] and [Ltac t1 := t0.], then [t1] is considered to
   run 0(!) times.  It evaluates to [t] during tactic expression
   evaluation, and although the call trace records the fact that it
   was called by [t0] which was called by [t1], the tactic running
   phase never sees this.  Thus we get one call tree (from expression
   evaluation) that has [t1] calls [t0] calls [t], and another call
   tree which says that the caller of [t1] calls [t] directly; the
   expression evaluation time goes in the first tree, and the call
   count and tactic running time goes in the second tree.  Alas, I
   suspect that fixing this requires a redesign of how the profiler
   hooks into the tactic engine. *)
