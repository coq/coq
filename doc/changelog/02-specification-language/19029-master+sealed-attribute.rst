- **Added:**
  New attributes :attr:`sealed` and :attr:`defined` allow to change
  the default opacity (now called sealing to prevent the confusion
  with the notion of opacity implemented by the command :cmd:`Opaque`)
  of a definition or theorem
  (`#19029 <https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/19029>`_,
  by Hugo Herbelin).
