- **Changed:**
  The :cmd:`Add Field` no longer declares ring structures. This was
  undocumented and less flexible than letting the user define her ring
  instances. Also, user-defined ring instances could be erased by field
  declarations (`#10734 <https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/10734>`_,
  by Maxime Dénès).
