# Welcome to Coq!

Coq is a system designed to help people to mechanically-verify all
kind of formal proofs; Coq has been developed for more than 35 years,
and indeed it is a rich and complex system!

We sincerely hope you will have a lot fun using the system; we remind
you that Coq is developed in an open fashion and you are very welcome
to provide feedback or contribute at any time.

## Installation and Integrated Development Environments

Installing Coq can be sometimes more of a challenge than using the
system itself. Owning to its research roots, Coq has been developed in
Unix-based systems for a long time, so you may find trouble otherwise.

Moreover, the Coq distribution itself is quite bare, as it doesn't
include large bodies of formal developments which are mandatory for
example to be able to do meaningful mathematics or verification.

Fortunately, as of today most Coq packages and the system itself are
available from the OPAM package manager. That should be your first
option. If that fails, you can try the binary packages available from
the release page.

Another option to play with Coq is to use its browser-based version,
available at https://x80.org/collacoq/

### Developing with Coq

Installing Coq is far from the end, the second, and most crucial step
is to get a comfortable development environment so you can proceed
ahead to do interactive proofs. As of today the main interfaces are:

- Proof General [link to PG setup]
- CoqIDE [link to COQIDE setup]

Unfortunately, neither of these interfaces do fully integrate with the
build or documentation system as of today; help with this is much
welcome!

There are some other experimental IDEs available at [link to
alternative IDEs]
