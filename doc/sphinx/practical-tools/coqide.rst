|Coq| Integrated Development Environment
========================================

The Coq Integrated Development Environment is a graphical tool, to be
used as a user-friendly replacement to `coqtop`. Its main purpose is to
allow the user to navigate forward and backward into a Coq vernacular
file, executing corresponding commands or undoing them respectively.

|CoqIDE| is run by typing the command `coqide` on the command line.
Without argument, the main screen is displayed with an “unnamed
buffer”, and with a file name as argument, another buffer displaying
the contents of that file. Additionally, `coqide` accepts the same
options as `coqtop`, given in :ref:`thecoqcommands`, the ones having obviously
no meaning for |CoqIDE| being ignored.

.. _coqide_mainscreen:

A sample |CoqIDE| main screen, while navigating into a file `Fermat.v`,
is shown in the figure :ref:`CoqIDE main screen <coqide_mainscreen>`.
At the top is a menu bar, and a tool bar
below it. The large window on the left is displaying the various
*script buffers*. The upper right window is the *goal window*, where
goals to prove are displayed. The lower right window is the *message
window*, where various messages resulting from commands are displayed.
At the bottom is the status bar.

Managing files and buffers, basic editing
----------------------------------------------

In the script window, you may open arbitrarily many buffers to edit.
The *File* menu allows you to open files or create some, save them,
print or export them into various formats. Among all these buffers,
there is always one which is the current *running buffer*, whose name
is displayed on a background in the *processed* color (green by default), which
is the one where Coq commands are currently executed.

Buffers may be edited as in any text editor, and classical basic
editing commands (Copy/Paste, …) are available in the *Edit* menu.
|CoqIDE| offers only basic editing commands, so if you need more complex
editing commands, you may launch your favorite text editor on the
current buffer, using the *Edit/External Editor* menu.

Interactive navigation into Coq scripts
--------------------------------------------

The running buffer is the one where navigation takes place. The toolbar offers
five basic commands for this. The first one, represented by a down arrow icon,
is for going forward executing one command. If that command is successful, the
part of the script that has been executed is displayed on a background with the
processed color. If that command fails, the error message is displayed in the
message window, and the location of the error is emphasized by an underline in
the error foreground color (red by default).

In the figure :ref:`CoqIDE main screen <coqide_mainscreen>`,
the running buffer is `Fermat.v`, all commands until
the ``Theorem`` have been already executed, and the user tried to go
forward executing ``Induction n``. That command failed because no such
tactic exists (tactics are now in lowercase…), and the wrong word is
underlined.

Notice that the processed part of the running buffer is not editable. If
you ever want to modify something you have to go backward using the up
arrow tool, or even better, put the cursor where you want to go back
and use the goto button. Unlike with `coqtop`, you should never use
``Undo`` to go backward.

There are two additional buttons for navigation within the running buffer. The
"down" button with a line goes directly to the end; the "up" button with a line
goes back to the beginning. The handling of errors when using the go-to-the-end
button depends on whether |Coq| is running in asynchronous mode or not (see
Chapter :ref:`asynchronousandparallelproofprocessing`). If it is not running in that mode, execution
stops as soon as an error is found. Otherwise, execution continues, and the
error is marked with an underline in the error foreground color, with a
background in the error background color (pink by default). The same
characterization of error-handling applies when running several commands using
the "goto" button.

If you ever try to execute a command which happens to run during a
long time, and would like to abort it before its termination, you may
use the interrupt button (the white cross on a red circle).

There are other buttons on the |CoqIDE| toolbar: a button to save the running
buffer; a button to close the current buffer (an "X"); buttons to switch among
buffers (left and right arrows); an "information" button; and a "gears" button.

The "information" button is described in Section :ref:`try-tactics-automatically`.

The "gears" button submits proof terms to the |Coq| kernel for type-checking.
When |Coq| uses asynchronous processing (see Chapter :ref:`asynchronousandparallelproofprocessing`),
proofs may have been completed without kernel-checking of generated proof terms.
The presence of unchecked proof terms is indicated by ``Qed`` statements that
have a subdued *being-processed* color (light blue by default), rather than the
processed color, though their preceding proofs have the processed color.

Notice that for all these buttons, except for the "gears" button, their operations
are also available in the menu, where their keyboard shortcuts are given.

.. _try-tactics-automatically:

Trying tactics automatically
------------------------------

The menu Try Tactics provides some features for automatically trying
to solve the current goal using simple tactics. If such a tactic
succeeds in solving the goal, then its text is automatically inserted
into the script. There is finally a combination of these tactics,
called the *proof wizard* which will try each of them in turn. This
wizard is also available as a tool button (the "information" button). The set of
tactics tried by the wizard is customizable in the preferences.

These tactics are general ones, in particular they do not refer to
particular hypotheses. You may also try specific tactics related to
the goal or one of the hypotheses, by clicking with the right mouse
button on the goal or the considered hypothesis. This is the
“contextual menu on goals” feature, that may be disabled in the
preferences if undesirable.


Proof folding
------------------

As your script grows bigger and bigger, it might be useful to hide the
proofs of your theorems and lemmas.

This feature is toggled via the Hide entry of the Navigation menu. The
proof shall be enclosed between ``Proof.`` and ``Qed.``, both with their final
dots. The proof that shall be hidden or revealed is the first one
whose beginning statement (such as ``Theorem``) precedes the insertion
cursor.


Vernacular commands, templates
-----------------------------------

The Templates menu allows using shortcuts to insert vernacular
commands. This is a nice way to proceed if you are not sure of the
spelling of the command you want.

Moreover, this menu offers some *templates* which will automatic
insert a complex command like ``Fixpoint`` with a convenient shape for its
arguments.

Queries
------------

.. _coqide_queryselected:

.. image:: ../_static/coqide-queries.png
   :alt: |CoqIDE| queries

We call *query* any vernacular command that does not change the current state,
such as ``Check``, ``Search``, etc. To run such commands interactively, without
writing them in scripts, |CoqIDE| offers a *query pane*. The query pane can be
displayed on demand by using the ``View`` menu, or using the shortcut ``F1``.
Queries can also be performed by selecting a particular phrase, then choosing an
item from the ``Queries`` menu. The response then appears in the message window.
Figure :ref:`fig:queryselected` shows the result after selecting of the phrase
``Nat.mul`` in the script window, and choosing ``Print`` from the ``Queries``
menu.


Compilation
----------------

The `Compile` menu offers direct commands to:

+ compile the current buffer
+ run a compilation using `make`
+ go to the last compilation error
+ create a `Makefile` using `coq_makefile`.

Customizations
-------------------

You may customize your environment using menu Edit/Preferences. A new
window will be displayed, with several customization sections
presented as a notebook.

The first section is for selecting the text font used for scripts,
goal and message windows.

The second section is devoted to file management: you may configure
automatic saving of files, by periodically saving the contents into
files named `#f#` for each opened file `f`. You may also activate the
*revert* feature: in case a opened file is modified on the disk by a
third party, |CoqIDE| may read it again for you. Note that in the case
you edited that same file, you will be prompt to choose to either
discard your changes or not. The File charset encoding choice is
described below in :ref:`character-encoding-saved-files`.

The `Externals` section allows customizing the external commands for
compilation, printing, web browsing. In the browser command, you may
use `%s` to denote the URL to open, for example:
`firefox -remote "OpenURL(%s)"`.

The `Tactics Wizard` section allows defining the set of tactics that
should be tried, in sequence, to solve the current goal.

The last section is for miscellaneous boolean settings, such as the
“contextual menu on goals” feature presented in the section
:ref:`Try tactics automatically <try-tactics-automatically>`.

Notice that these settings are saved in the file `.coqiderc` of your
home directory.

A Gtk2 accelerator keymap is saved under the name `.coqide.keys`. It
is not recommanded to edit this file manually: to modify a given menu
shortcut, go to the corresponding menu item without releasing the
mouse button, press the key you want for the new shortcut, and release
the mouse button afterwards. If your system does not allow it, you may
still edit this configuration file by hand, but this is more involved.


Using Unicode symbols
--------------------------

|CoqIDE| is based on GTK+ and inherits from it support for Unicode in
its text windows. Consequently a large set of symbols is available for
notations.


Displaying Unicode symbols
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You just need to define suitable notations as described in the chapter
:ref:`syntaxextensionsandinterpretationscopes`. For example, to use the
mathematical symbols ∀ and ∃, you may define:

.. coqtop:: in

  Notation "∀ x : T, P" :=
  (forall x : T, P) (at level 200, x ident).
  Notation "∃ x : T, P" :=
  (exists x : T, P) (at level 200, x ident).

There exists a small set of such notations already defined, in the
file `utf8.v` of Coq library, so you may enable them just by
``Require utf8`` inside |CoqIDE|, or equivalently, by starting |CoqIDE| with
``coqide -l utf8``.

However, there are some issues when using such Unicode symbols: you of
course need to use a character font which supports them. In the Fonts
section of the preferences, the Preview line displays some Unicode
symbols, so you could figure out if the selected font is OK. Related
to this, one thing you may need to do is choose whether GTK+ should
use antialiased fonts or not, by setting the environment variable
`GDK_USE_XFT` to 1 or 0 respectively.


Defining an input method for non-ASCII symbols
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To input a Unicode symbol, a general method provided by GTK+ is to
simultaneously press the Control, Shift and “u” keys, release, then
type the hexadecimal code of the symbol required, for example `2200`
for the ∀ symbol. A list of symbol codes is available at
`http://www.unicode.org`.

An alternative method which does not require to know the hexadecimal
code of the character is to use an Input Method Editor. On POSIX
systems (Linux distributions, BSD variants and MacOS X), you can
use `uim` version 1.6 or later which provides a :math:`\LaTeX`-style input
method.

To configure uim, execute uim-pref-gtk as your regular user. In the
"Global Settings" group set the default Input Method to "ELatin"
(don’t forget to tick the checkbox "Specify default IM"). In the
"ELatin" group set the layout to "TeX", and remember the content of
the "[ELatin] on" field (by default Control-\\). You can now execute
|CoqIDE| with the following commands (assuming you use a Bourne-style
shell):

::

    $ export GTK_IM_MODULE=uim
    $ coqide


Activate the ELatin Input Method with Control-\\, then type the
sequence `\\Gamma`. You will see the sequence being replaced by Γ as
soon as you type the second "a".

.. _character-encoding-saved-files:

Character encoding for saved files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the Files section of the preferences, the encoding option is
related to the way files are saved.

If you have no need to exchange files with non UTF-8 aware
applications, it is better to choose the UTF-8 encoding, since it
guarantees that your files will be read again without problems. (This
is because when |CoqIDE| reads a file, it tries to automatically detect
its character encoding.)

If you choose something else than UTF-8, then missing characters will
be written encoded by `\x{....}` or `\x{........}` where each dot is
an hexadecimal digit: the number between braces is the hexadecimal
Unicode index for the missing character.
