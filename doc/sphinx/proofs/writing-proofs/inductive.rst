Reasoning with inductive types
==============================

Applying constructors
---------------------

The tactics presented here specialize :tacn:`apply` (and
:tacn:`eapply`) to the case of constructors of inductive types.

.. tacn:: constructor @natural
   :name: constructor

   This tactic applies to a goal such that its conclusion is an inductive
   type (say :g:`I`). The argument :token:`natural` must be less or equal to the
   numbers of constructor(s) of :g:`I`. Let :n:`c__i` be the i-th
   constructor of :g:`I`, then :g:`constructor i` is equivalent to
   :n:`intros; apply c__i`.

   .. exn:: Not an inductive product.
      :undocumented:

   .. exn:: Not enough constructors.
      :undocumented:

   .. tacv:: constructor

      This tries :g:`constructor 1` then :g:`constructor 2`, ..., then
      :g:`constructor n` where ``n`` is the number of constructors of the head
      of the goal.

   .. tacv:: constructor @natural with @bindings

      Let ``c`` be the i-th constructor of :g:`I`, then
      :n:`constructor i with @bindings` is equivalent to
      :n:`intros; apply c with @bindings`.

      .. warning::

         The terms in :token:`bindings` are checked in the context
         where constructor is executed and not in the context where :tacn:`apply`
         is executed (the introductions are not taken into account).

   .. tacv:: split {? with @bindings }
      :name: split

      This applies only if :g:`I` has a single constructor. It is then
      equivalent to :n:`constructor 1 {? with @bindings }`. It is
      typically used in the case of a conjunction :math:`A \wedge B`.

      .. tacv:: exists @bindings
         :name: exists

         This applies only if :g:`I` has a single constructor. It is then equivalent
         to :n:`intros; constructor 1 with @bindings.` It is typically used in
         the case of an existential quantification :math:`\exists x, P(x).`

      .. tacv:: exists {+, @bindings }

         This iteratively applies :n:`exists @bindings`.

      .. exn:: Not an inductive goal with 1 constructor.
         :undocumented:

   .. tacv:: left {? with @bindings }
             right {? with @bindings }
      :name: left; right

      These tactics apply only if :g:`I` has two constructors, for
      instance in the case of a disjunction :math:`A \vee B`.
      Then, they are respectively equivalent to
      :n:`constructor 1 {? with @bindings }` and
      :n:`constructor 2 {? with @bindings }`.

      .. exn:: Not an inductive goal with 2 constructors.
         :undocumented:

   .. tacv:: econstructor
             eexists
             esplit
             eleft
             eright
      :name: econstructor; eexists; esplit; eleft; eright

      These tactics and their variants behave like :tacn:`constructor`,
      :tacn:`exists`, :tacn:`split`, :tacn:`left`, :tacn:`right` and their
      variants but they introduce existential variables instead of failing
      when the instantiation of a variable cannot be found
      (cf. :tacn:`eapply` and :tacn:`apply`).

.. _CaseAnalysisAndInduction:

Case analysis and induction
-------------------------------

The tactics presented in this section implement induction or case
analysis on inductive or co-inductive objects (see :ref:`inductive-definitions`).

.. tacn:: destruct @term
   :name: destruct

   This tactic applies to any goal. The argument :token:`term` must be of
   inductive or co-inductive type and the tactic generates subgoals, one
   for each possible form of :token:`term`, i.e. one for each constructor of the
   inductive or co-inductive type. Unlike :tacn:`induction`, no induction
   hypothesis is generated by :tacn:`destruct`.

   .. tacv:: destruct @ident

      If :token:`ident` denotes a quantified variable of the conclusion
      of the goal, then :n:`destruct @ident` behaves
      as :n:`intros until @ident; destruct @ident`. If :token:`ident` is not
      anymore dependent in the goal after application of :tacn:`destruct`, it
      is erased (to avoid erasure, use parentheses, as in :n:`destruct (@ident)`).

      If :token:`ident` is a hypothesis of the context, and :token:`ident`
      is not anymore dependent in the goal after application
      of :tacn:`destruct`, it is erased (to avoid erasure, use parentheses, as
      in :n:`destruct (@ident)`).

   .. tacv:: destruct @natural

      :n:`destruct @natural` behaves as :n:`intros until @natural`
      followed by destruct applied to the last introduced hypothesis.

     .. note::
        For destruction of a number, use syntax :n:`destruct (@natural)` (not
        very interesting anyway).

   .. tacv:: destruct @pattern

      The argument of :tacn:`destruct` can also be a pattern of which holes are
      denoted by “_”. In this case, the tactic checks that all subterms
      matching the pattern in the conclusion and the hypotheses are compatible
      and performs case analysis using this subterm.

   .. tacv:: destruct {+, @term}

      This is a shortcut for :n:`destruct @term; ...; destruct @term`.

   .. tacv:: destruct @term as @or_and_intropattern_loc

      This behaves as :n:`destruct @term` but uses the names
      in :token:`or_and_intropattern_loc` to name the variables introduced in the
      context. The :token:`or_and_intropattern_loc` must have the
      form :n:`[p11 ... p1n | ... | pm1 ... pmn ]` with ``m`` being the
      number of constructors of the type of :token:`term`. Each variable
      introduced by :tacn:`destruct` in the context of the ``i``-th goal
      gets its name from the list :n:`pi1 ... pin` in order. If there are not
      enough names, :tacn:`destruct` invents names for the remaining variables
      to introduce. More generally, the :n:`pij` can be any introduction
      pattern (see :tacn:`intros`). This provides a concise notation for
      chaining destruction of a hypothesis.

   .. tacv:: destruct @term eqn:@naming_intropattern
      :name: destruct … eqn:

      This behaves as :n:`destruct @term` but adds an equation
      between :token:`term` and the value that it takes in each of the
      possible cases. The name of the equation is specified
      by :token:`naming_intropattern` (see :tacn:`intros`),
      in particular ``?`` can be used to let Coq generate a fresh name.

   .. tacv:: destruct @term with @bindings

      This behaves like :n:`destruct @term` providing explicit instances for
      the dependent premises of the type of :token:`term`.

   .. tacv:: edestruct @term
      :name: edestruct

      This tactic behaves like :n:`destruct @term` except that it does not
      fail if the instance of a dependent premises of the type
      of :token:`term` is not inferable. Instead, the unresolved instances
      are left as existential variables to be inferred later, in the same way
      as :tacn:`eapply` does.

   .. tacv:: destruct @term using @term {? with @bindings }

      This is synonym of :n:`induction @term using @term {? with @bindings }`.

   .. tacv:: destruct @term in @goal_occurrences

      This syntax is used for selecting which occurrences of :token:`term`
      the case analysis has to be done on. The :n:`in @goal_occurrences`
      clause is an occurrence clause whose syntax and behavior is described
      in :ref:`occurrences sets <occurrencessets>`.

   .. tacv:: destruct @term {? with @bindings } {? as @or_and_intropattern_loc } {? eqn:@naming_intropattern } {? using @term {? with @bindings } } {? in @goal_occurrences }
             edestruct @term {? with @bindings } {? as @or_and_intropattern_loc } {? eqn:@naming_intropattern } {? using @term {? with @bindings } } {? in @goal_occurrences }

      These are the general forms of :tacn:`destruct` and :tacn:`edestruct`.
      They combine the effects of the ``with``, ``as``, ``eqn:``, ``using``,
      and ``in`` clauses.

.. tacn:: case @term
   :name: case

   The tactic :n:`case` is a more basic tactic to perform case analysis without
   recursion. It behaves as :n:`elim @term` but using a case-analysis
   elimination principle and not a recursive one.

.. tacv:: case @term with @bindings

   Analogous to :n:`elim @term with @bindings` above.

.. tacv:: ecase @term {? with @bindings }
   :name: ecase

   In case the type of :n:`@term` has dependent premises, or dependent premises
   whose values are not inferable from the :n:`with @bindings` clause,
   :n:`ecase` turns them into existential variables to be resolved later on.

.. tacv:: simple destruct @ident
   :name: simple destruct

   This tactic behaves as :n:`intros until @ident; case @ident` when :n:`@ident`
   is a quantified variable of the goal.

.. tacv:: simple destruct @natural

   This tactic behaves as :n:`intros until @natural; case @ident` where :n:`@ident`
   is the name given by :n:`intros until @natural` to the :n:`@natural` -th
   non-dependent premise of the goal.

.. tacv:: case_eq @term

   The tactic :n:`case_eq` is a variant of the :n:`case` tactic that allows to
   perform case analysis on a term without completely forgetting its original
   form. This is done by generating equalities between the original form of the
   term and the outcomes of the case analysis.

.. tacn:: induction @term
   :name: induction

   This tactic applies to any goal. The argument :n:`@term` must be of
   inductive type and the tactic :n:`induction` generates subgoals, one for
   each possible form of :n:`@term`, i.e. one for each constructor of the
   inductive type.

   If the argument is dependent in either the conclusion or some
   hypotheses of the goal, the argument is replaced by the appropriate
   constructor form in each of the resulting subgoals and induction
   hypotheses are added to the local context using names whose prefix
   is **IH**.

   There are particular cases:

   + If term is an identifier :n:`@ident` denoting a quantified variable of the
     conclusion of the goal, then inductionident behaves as :n:`intros until
     @ident; induction @ident`. If :n:`@ident` is not anymore dependent in the
     goal after application of :n:`induction`, it is erased (to avoid erasure,
     use parentheses, as in :n:`induction (@ident)`).
   + If :n:`@term` is a :n:`@natural`, then :n:`induction @natural` behaves as
     :n:`intros until @natural` followed by :n:`induction` applied to the last
     introduced hypothesis.

     .. note::
        For simple induction on a number, use syntax induction (number)
        (not very interesting anyway).

   + In case term is a hypothesis :n:`@ident` of the context, and :n:`@ident`
     is not anymore dependent in the goal after application of :n:`induction`,
     it is erased (to avoid erasure, use parentheses, as in
     :n:`induction (@ident)`).
   + The argument :n:`@term` can also be a pattern of which holes are denoted
     by “_”. In this case, the tactic checks that all subterms matching the
     pattern in the conclusion and the hypotheses are compatible and
     performs induction using this subterm.

.. example::

   .. coqtop:: reset all

      Lemma induction_test : forall n:nat, n = n -> n <= n.
      intros n H.
      induction n.
      exact (le_n 0).

.. exn:: Not an inductive product.
   :undocumented:

.. exn:: Unable to find an instance for the variables @ident ... @ident.

   Use in this case the variant :tacn:`elim … with` below.

.. tacv:: induction @term as @or_and_intropattern_loc

   This behaves as :tacn:`induction` but uses the names in
   :n:`@or_and_intropattern_loc` to name the variables introduced in the
   context. The :n:`@or_and_intropattern_loc` must typically be of the form
   :n:`[ p` :sub:`11` :n:`... p` :sub:`1n` :n:`| ... | p`:sub:`m1` :n:`... p`:sub:`mn` :n:`]`
   with :n:`m` being the number of constructors of the type of :n:`@term`. Each
   variable introduced by induction in the context of the i-th goal gets its
   name from the list :n:`p`:sub:`i1` :n:`... p`:sub:`in` in order. If there are
   not enough names, induction invents names for the remaining variables to
   introduce. More generally, the :n:`p`:sub:`ij` can be any
   disjunctive/conjunctive introduction pattern (see :tacn:`intros …`). For
   instance, for an inductive type with  one constructor, the pattern notation
   :n:`(p`:sub:`1` :n:`, ... , p`:sub:`n` :n:`)` can be used instead of
   :n:`[ p`:sub:`1` :n:`... p`:sub:`n` :n:`]`.

.. tacv:: induction @term with @bindings

   This behaves like :tacn:`induction` providing explicit instances for the
   premises of the type of :n:`term` (see :ref:`bindings`).

.. tacv:: einduction @term
   :name: einduction

   This tactic behaves like :tacn:`induction` except that it does not fail if
   some dependent premise of the type of :n:`@term` is not inferable. Instead,
   the unresolved premises are posed as existential variables to be inferred
   later, in the same way as :tacn:`eapply` does.

.. tacv:: induction @term using @term
   :name: induction … using …

   This behaves as :tacn:`induction`  but using :n:`@term` as induction scheme.
   It does not expect the conclusion of the type of the first :n:`@term` to be
   inductive.

.. tacv:: induction @term using @term with @bindings

   This behaves as :tacn:`induction … using …` but also providing instances
   for the premises of the type of the second :n:`@term`.

.. tacv:: induction {+, @term} using @qualid

   This syntax is used for the case :n:`@qualid` denotes an induction principle
   with complex predicates as the induction principles generated by
   ``Function`` or ``Functional Scheme`` may be.

.. tacv:: induction @term in @goal_occurrences

   This syntax is used for selecting which occurrences of :n:`@term` the
   induction has to be carried on. The :n:`in @goal_occurrences` clause is an
   occurrence clause whose syntax and behavior is described in
   :ref:`occurrences sets <occurrencessets>`. If variables or hypotheses not
   mentioning :n:`@term` in their type are listed in :n:`@goal_occurrences`,
   those are generalized as well in the statement to prove.

   .. example::

      .. coqtop:: reset all

         Lemma comm x y : x + y = y + x.
         induction y in x |-   *.
         Show 2.

.. tacv:: induction @term with @bindings as @or_and_intropattern_loc using @term with @bindings in @goal_occurrences
          einduction @term with @bindings as @or_and_intropattern_loc using @term with @bindings in @goal_occurrences

   These are the most general forms of :tacn:`induction` and :tacn:`einduction`. It combines the
   effects of the with, as, using, and in clauses.

.. tacv:: elim @term
   :name: elim

   This is a more basic induction tactic. Again, the type of the argument
   :n:`@term` must be an inductive type. Then, according to the type of the
   goal, the tactic ``elim`` chooses the appropriate destructor and applies it
   as the tactic :tacn:`apply` would do. For instance, if the local context
   contains :g:`n:nat` and the current goal is :g:`T` of type :g:`Prop`, then
   :n:`elim n` is equivalent to :n:`apply nat_ind with (n:=n)`. The tactic
   ``elim`` does not modify the context of the goal, neither introduces the
   induction loading into the context of hypotheses. More generally,
   :n:`elim @term` also works when the type of :n:`@term` is a statement
   with premises and whose conclusion is inductive. In that case the tactic
   performs induction on the conclusion of the type of :n:`@term` and leaves the
   non-dependent premises of the type as subgoals. In the case of dependent
   products, the tactic tries to find an instance for which the elimination
   lemma applies and fails otherwise.

.. tacv:: elim @term with @bindings
   :name: elim … with

   Allows to give explicit instances to the premises of the type of :n:`@term`
   (see :ref:`bindings`).

.. tacv:: eelim @term
   :name: eelim

   In case the type of :n:`@term` has dependent premises, this turns them into
   existential variables to be resolved later on.

.. tacv:: elim @term using @term
          elim @term using @term with @bindings

   Allows the user to give explicitly an induction principle :n:`@term` that
   is not the standard one for the underlying inductive type of :n:`@term`. The
   :n:`@bindings` clause allows instantiating premises of the type of
   :n:`@term`.

.. tacv:: elim @term with @bindings using @term with @bindings
          eelim @term with @bindings using @term with @bindings

   These are the most general forms of :tacn:`elim` and :tacn:`eelim`. It combines the
   effects of the ``using`` clause and of the two uses of the ``with`` clause.

.. tacv:: elimtype @type
   :name: elimtype

   The argument :token:`type` must be inductively defined. :n:`elimtype I` is
   equivalent to :n:`cut I. intro Hn; elim Hn; clear Hn.` Therefore the
   hypothesis :g:`Hn` will not appear in the context(s) of the subgoal(s).
   Conversely, if :g:`t` is a :n:`@term` of (inductive) type :g:`I` that does
   not occur in the goal, then :n:`elim t` is equivalent to
   :n:`elimtype I; 2:exact t.`

.. tacv:: simple induction @ident
   :name: simple induction

   This tactic behaves as :n:`intros until @ident; elim @ident` when
   :n:`@ident` is a quantified variable of the goal.

.. tacv:: simple induction @natural

   This tactic behaves as :n:`intros until @natural; elim @ident` where :n:`@ident`
   is the name given by :n:`intros until @natural` to the :n:`@natural`-th non-dependent
   premise of the goal.

.. tacn:: dependent induction @ident
   :name: dependent induction

   The *experimental* tactic dependent induction performs induction-
   inversion on an instantiated inductive predicate. One needs to first
   require the Coq.Program.Equality module to use this tactic. The tactic
   is based on the BasicElim tactic by Conor McBride
   :cite:`DBLP:conf/types/McBride00` and the work of Cristina Cornes around
   inversion :cite:`DBLP:conf/types/CornesT95`. From an instantiated
   inductive predicate and a goal, it generates an equivalent goal where
   the hypothesis has been generalized over its indexes which are then
   constrained by equalities to be the right instances. This permits to
   state lemmas without resorting to manually adding these equalities and
   still get enough information in the proofs.

.. example::

   .. coqtop:: reset all

      Lemma lt_1_r : forall n:nat, n < 1 -> n = 0.
      intros n H ; induction H.

   Here we did not get any information on the indexes to help fulfill
   this proof. The problem is that, when we use the ``induction`` tactic, we
   lose information on the hypothesis instance, notably that the second
   argument is 1 here. Dependent induction solves this problem by adding
   the corresponding equality to the context.

   .. coqtop:: reset all

      Require Import Coq.Program.Equality.
      Lemma lt_1_r : forall n:nat, n < 1 -> n = 0.
      intros n H ; dependent induction H.

   The subgoal is cleaned up as the tactic tries to automatically
   simplify the subgoals with respect to the generated equalities. In
   this enriched context, it becomes possible to solve this subgoal.

   .. coqtop:: all

      reflexivity.

   Now we are in a contradictory context and the proof can be solved.

   .. coqtop:: all abort

      inversion H.

   This technique works with any inductive predicate. In fact, the
   ``dependent induction`` tactic is just a wrapper around the ``induction``
   tactic. One can make its own variant by just writing a new tactic
   based on the definition found in ``Coq.Program.Equality``.

.. tacv:: dependent induction @ident generalizing {+ @ident}

   This performs dependent induction on the hypothesis :n:`@ident` but first
   generalizes the goal by the given variables so that they are universally
   quantified in the goal. This is generally what one wants to do with the
   variables that are inside some constructors in the induction hypothesis. The
   other ones need not be further generalized.

.. tacv:: dependent destruction @ident
   :name: dependent destruction

   This performs the generalization of the instance :n:`@ident` but uses
   ``destruct`` instead of induction on the generalized hypothesis. This gives
   results equivalent to ``inversion`` or ``dependent inversion`` if the
   hypothesis is dependent.

See also the larger example of :tacn:`dependent induction`
and an explanation of the underlying technique.

.. seealso:: :tacn:`functional induction`

.. tacn:: discriminate @term
   :name: discriminate

   This tactic proves any goal from an assumption stating that two
   structurally different :n:`@term`\s of an inductive set are equal. For
   example, from :g:`(S (S O))=(S O)` we can derive by absurdity any
   proposition.

   The argument :n:`@term` is assumed to be a proof of a statement of
   conclusion :n:`@term = @term` with the two terms being elements of an
   inductive set. To build the proof, the tactic traverses the normal forms
   [1]_ of the terms looking for a couple of subterms :g:`u` and :g:`w` (:g:`u`
   subterm of the normal form of :n:`@term` and :g:`w` subterm of the normal
   form of :n:`@term`), placed at the same positions and whose head symbols are
   two different constructors. If such a couple of subterms exists, then the
   proof of the current goal is completed, otherwise the tactic fails.

.. note::
   The syntax :n:`discriminate @ident` can be used to refer to a hypothesis
   quantified in the goal. In this case, the quantified hypothesis whose name is
   :n:`@ident` is first introduced in the local context using
   :n:`intros until @ident`.

.. exn:: No primitive equality found.
   :undocumented:

.. exn:: Not a discriminable equality.
   :undocumented:

.. tacv:: discriminate @natural

   This does the same thing as :n:`intros until @natural` followed by
   :n:`discriminate @ident` where :n:`@ident` is the identifier for the last
   introduced hypothesis.

.. tacv:: discriminate @term with @bindings

   This does the same thing as :n:`discriminate @term` but using the given
   bindings to instantiate parameters or hypotheses of :n:`@term`.

.. tacv:: ediscriminate @natural
          ediscriminate @term {? with @bindings}
   :name: ediscriminate; _

   This works the same as :tacn:`discriminate` but if the type of :token:`term`, or the
   type of the hypothesis referred to by :token:`natural`, has uninstantiated
   parameters, these parameters are left as existential variables.

.. tacv:: discriminate

   This behaves like :n:`discriminate @ident` if ident is the name of an
   hypothesis to which ``discriminate`` is applicable; if the current goal is of
   the form :n:`@term <> @term`, this behaves as
   :n:`intro @ident; discriminate @ident`.

   .. exn:: No discriminable equalities.
      :undocumented:

.. tacn:: injection @term
   :name: injection

   The injection tactic exploits the property that constructors of
   inductive types are injective, i.e. that if :g:`c` is a constructor of an
   inductive type and :g:`c t`:sub:`1` and :g:`c t`:sub:`2` are equal then
   :g:`t`:sub:`1` and :g:`t`:sub:`2` are equal too.

   If :n:`@term` is a proof of a statement of conclusion :n:`@term = @term`,
   then :tacn:`injection` applies the injectivity of constructors as deep as
   possible to derive the equality of all the subterms of :n:`@term` and
   :n:`@term` at positions where the terms start to differ. For example, from
   :g:`(S p, S n) = (q, S (S m))` we may derive :g:`S p = q` and
   :g:`n = S m`. For this tactic to work, the terms should be typed with an
   inductive type and they should be neither convertible, nor having a different
   head constructor. If these conditions are satisfied, the tactic derives the
   equality of all the subterms at positions where they differ and adds them as
   antecedents to the conclusion of the current goal.

   .. example::

      Consider the following goal:

      .. coqtop:: in

         Inductive list : Set :=
         | nil : list
         | cons : nat -> list -> list.
         Parameter P : list -> Prop.
         Goal forall l n, P nil -> cons n l = cons 0 nil -> P l.

      .. coqtop:: all

         intros.
         injection H0.

   Beware that injection yields an equality in a sigma type whenever the
   injected object has a dependent type :g:`P` with its two instances in
   different types :g:`(P t`:sub:`1` :g:`... t`:sub:`n` :g:`)` and
   :g:`(P u`:sub:`1` :g:`... u`:sub:`n` :sub:`)`. If :g:`t`:sub:`1` and
   :g:`u`:sub:`1` are the same and have for type an inductive type for which a decidable
   equality has been declared using :cmd:`Scheme` :n:`Equality ...`
   (see :ref:`proofschemes-induction-principles`),
   the use of a sigma type is avoided.

   .. note::
      If some quantified hypothesis of the goal is named :n:`@ident`,
      then :n:`injection @ident` first introduces the hypothesis in the local
      context using :n:`intros until @ident`.

   .. exn:: Nothing to do, it is an equality between convertible terms.
      :undocumented:

   .. exn:: Not a primitive equality.
      :undocumented:

   .. exn:: Nothing to inject.

      This error is given when one side of the equality is not a constructor.

   .. tacv:: injection @natural

      This does the same thing as :n:`intros until @natural` followed by
      :n:`injection @ident` where :n:`@ident` is the identifier for the last
      introduced hypothesis.

   .. tacv:: injection @term with @bindings

      This does the same as :n:`injection @term` but using the given bindings to
      instantiate parameters or hypotheses of :n:`@term`.

   .. tacv:: einjection @natural
             einjection @term {? with @bindings}
      :name: einjection; _

      This works the same as :n:`injection` but if the type of :n:`@term`, or the
      type of the hypothesis referred to by :n:`@natural`, has uninstantiated
      parameters, these parameters are left as existential variables.

   .. tacv:: injection

      If the current goal is of the form :n:`@term <> @term` , this behaves as
      :n:`intro @ident; injection @ident`.

      .. exn:: goal does not satisfy the expected preconditions.
         :undocumented:

   .. tacv:: injection @term {? with @bindings} as {+ @simple_intropattern}
             injection @natural as {+ @simple_intropattern}
             injection as {+ @simple_intropattern}
             einjection @term {? with @bindings} as {+ @simple_intropattern}
             einjection @natural as {+ @simple_intropattern}
             einjection as {+ @simple_intropattern}

      These variants apply :n:`intros {+ @simple_intropattern}` after the call to
      :tacn:`injection` or :tacn:`einjection` so that all equalities generated are moved in
      the context of hypotheses. The number of :n:`@simple_intropattern` must not exceed
      the number of equalities newly generated. If it is smaller, fresh
      names are automatically generated to adjust the list of :n:`@simple_intropattern`
      to the number of new equalities. The original equality is erased if it
      corresponds to a hypothesis.

   .. tacv:: injection @term {? with @bindings} as @injection_intropattern
             injection @natural as @injection_intropattern
             injection as @injection_intropattern
             einjection @term {? with @bindings} as @injection_intropattern
             einjection @natural as @injection_intropattern
             einjection as @injection_intropattern

      These are equivalent to the previous variants but using instead the
      syntax :token:`injection_intropattern` which :tacn:`intros`
      uses. In particular :n:`as [= {+ @simple_intropattern}]` behaves
      the same as :n:`as {+ @simple_intropattern}`.

   .. flag:: Structural Injection

      This flag ensures that :n:`injection @term` erases the original hypothesis
      and leaves the generated equalities in the context rather than putting them
      as antecedents of the current goal, as if giving :n:`injection @term as`
      (with an empty list of names). This flag is off by default.

   .. flag:: Keep Proof Equalities

      By default, :tacn:`injection` only creates new equalities between :n:`@term`\s
      whose type is in sort :g:`Type` or :g:`Set`, thus implementing a special
      behavior for objects that are proofs of a statement in :g:`Prop`. This flag
      controls this behavior.

.. tacn:: inversion @ident
   :name: inversion

   Let the type of :n:`@ident` in the local context be :g:`(I t)`, where :g:`I`
   is a (co)inductive predicate. Then, ``inversion`` applied to :n:`@ident`
   derives for each possible constructor :g:`c i` of :g:`(I t)`, all the
   necessary conditions that should hold for the instance :g:`(I t)` to be
   proved by :g:`c i`.

.. note::
   If :n:`@ident` does not denote a hypothesis in the local context but
   refers to a hypothesis quantified in the goal, then the latter is
   first introduced in the local context using :n:`intros until @ident`.

.. note::
   As ``inversion`` proofs may be large in size, we recommend the
   user to stock the lemmas whenever the same instance needs to be
   inverted several times. See :ref:`derive-inversion`.

.. note::
   Part of the behavior of the ``inversion`` tactic is to generate
   equalities between expressions that appeared in the hypothesis that is
   being processed. By default, no equalities are generated if they
   relate two proofs (i.e. equalities between :token:`term`\s whose type is in sort
   :g:`Prop`). This behavior can be turned off by using the
   :flag:`Keep Proof Equalities` setting.

.. tacv:: inversion @natural

   This does the same thing as :n:`intros until @natural` then :n:`inversion @ident`
   where :n:`@ident` is the identifier for the last introduced hypothesis.

.. tacv:: inversion_clear @ident
   :name: inversion_clear

   This behaves as :n:`inversion` and then erases :n:`@ident` from the context.

.. tacv:: inversion @ident as @or_and_intropattern_loc

   This generally behaves as inversion but using names in :n:`@or_and_intropattern_loc`
   for naming hypotheses. The :n:`@or_and_intropattern_loc` must have the form
   :n:`[p`:sub:`11` :n:`... p`:sub:`1n` :n:`| ... | p`:sub:`m1` :n:`... p`:sub:`mn` :n:`]`
   with `m` being the number of constructors of the type of :n:`@ident`. Be
   careful that the list must be of length `m` even if ``inversion`` discards
   some cases (which is precisely one of its roles): for the discarded
   cases, just use an empty list (i.e. `n = 0`).The arguments of the i-th
   constructor and the equalities that ``inversion`` introduces in the
   context of the goal corresponding to the i-th constructor, if it
   exists, get their names from the list :n:`p`:sub:`i1` :n:`... p`:sub:`in` in
   order. If there are not enough names, ``inversion`` invents names for the
   remaining variables to introduce. In case an equation splits into several
   equations (because ``inversion`` applies ``injection`` on the equalities it
   generates), the corresponding name :n:`p`:sub:`ij` in the list must be
   replaced by a sublist of the form :n:`[p`:sub:`ij1` :n:`... p`:sub:`ijq` :n:`]`
   (or, equivalently, :n:`(p`:sub:`ij1` :n:`, ..., p`:sub:`ijq` :n:`)`) where
   `q` is the number of subequalities obtained from splitting the original
   equation. Here is an example. The ``inversion ... as`` variant of
   ``inversion`` generally behaves in a slightly more expectable way than
   ``inversion`` (no artificial duplication of some hypotheses referring to
   other hypotheses). To take benefit of these improvements, it is enough to use
   ``inversion ... as []``, letting the names being finally chosen by Coq.

   .. example::

      .. coqtop:: reset all

         Inductive contains0 : list nat -> Prop :=
         | in_hd : forall l, contains0 (0 :: l)
         | in_tl : forall l b, contains0 l -> contains0 (b :: l).
         Goal forall l:list nat, contains0 (1 :: l) -> contains0 l.
         intros l H; inversion H as [ | l' p Hl' [Heqp Heql'] ].

.. tacv:: inversion @natural as @or_and_intropattern_loc

   This allows naming the hypotheses introduced by :n:`inversion @natural` in the
   context.

.. tacv:: inversion_clear @ident as @or_and_intropattern_loc

   This allows naming the hypotheses introduced by ``inversion_clear`` in the
   context. Notice that hypothesis names can be provided as if ``inversion``
   were called, even though the ``inversion_clear`` will eventually erase the
   hypotheses.

.. tacv:: inversion @ident in {+ @ident}

   Let :n:`{+ @ident}` be identifiers in the local context. This tactic behaves as
   generalizing :n:`{+ @ident}`, and then performing ``inversion``.

.. tacv:: inversion @ident as @or_and_intropattern_loc in {+ @ident}

   This allows naming the hypotheses introduced in the context by
   :n:`inversion @ident in {+ @ident}`.

.. tacv:: inversion_clear @ident in {+ @ident}

   Let :n:`{+ @ident}` be identifiers in the local context. This tactic behaves
   as generalizing :n:`{+ @ident}`, and then performing ``inversion_clear``.

.. tacv:: inversion_clear @ident as @or_and_intropattern_loc in {+ @ident}

   This allows naming the hypotheses introduced in the context by
   :n:`inversion_clear @ident in {+ @ident}`.

.. tacv:: dependent inversion @ident
   :name: dependent inversion

   That must be used when :n:`@ident` appears in the current goal. It acts like
   ``inversion`` and then substitutes :n:`@ident` for the corresponding
   :n:`@@term` in the goal.

.. tacv:: dependent inversion @ident as @or_and_intropattern_loc

   This allows naming the hypotheses introduced in the context by
   :n:`dependent inversion @ident`.

.. tacv:: dependent inversion_clear @ident

   Like ``dependent inversion``, except that :n:`@ident` is cleared from the
   local context.

.. tacv:: dependent inversion_clear @ident as @or_and_intropattern_loc

   This allows naming the hypotheses introduced in the context by
   :n:`dependent inversion_clear @ident`.

.. tacv:: dependent inversion @ident with @term
   :name: dependent inversion … with …

   This variant allows you to specify the generalization of the goal. It is
   useful when the system fails to generalize the goal automatically. If
   :n:`@ident` has type :g:`(I t)` and :g:`I` has type :g:`forall (x:T), s`,
   then :n:`@term` must be of type :g:`I:forall (x:T), I x -> s'` where
   :g:`s'` is the type of the goal.

.. tacv:: dependent inversion @ident as @or_and_intropattern_loc with @term

   This allows naming the hypotheses introduced in the context by
   :n:`dependent inversion @ident with @term`.

.. tacv:: dependent inversion_clear @ident with @term

   Like :tacn:`dependent inversion … with …` with but clears :n:`@ident` from the
   local context.

.. tacv:: dependent inversion_clear @ident as @or_and_intropattern_loc with @term

   This allows naming the hypotheses introduced in the context by
   :n:`dependent inversion_clear @ident with @term`.

.. tacv:: simple inversion @ident
   :name: simple inversion

   It is a very primitive inversion tactic that derives all the necessary
   equalities but it does not simplify the constraints as ``inversion`` does.

.. tacv:: simple inversion @ident as @or_and_intropattern_loc

   This allows naming the hypotheses introduced in the context by
   ``simple inversion``.

.. tacn:: inversion @ident using @ident
   :name: inversion ... using ...

   .. todo using … instead of ... in the name above gives a Sphinx error, even though
      this works just find for :tacn:`move`

   Let :n:`@ident` have type :g:`(I t)` (:g:`I` an inductive predicate) in the
   local context, and :n:`@ident` be a (dependent) inversion lemma. Then, this
   tactic refines the current goal with the specified lemma.

.. tacv:: inversion @ident using @ident in {+ @ident}

   This tactic behaves as generalizing :n:`{+ @ident}`, then doing
   :n:`inversion @ident using @ident`.

.. tacv:: inversion_sigma
   :name: inversion_sigma

   This tactic turns equalities of dependent pairs (e.g.,
   :g:`existT P x p = existT P y q`, frequently left over by inversion on
   a dependent type family) into pairs of equalities (e.g., a hypothesis
   :g:`H : x = y` and a hypothesis of type :g:`rew H in p = q`); these
   hypotheses can subsequently be simplified using :tacn:`subst`, without ever
   invoking any kind of axiom asserting uniqueness of identity proofs. If you
   want to explicitly specify the hypothesis to be inverted, or name the
   generated hypotheses, you can invoke
   :n:`induction H as [H1 H2] using eq_sigT_rect.` This tactic also works for
   :g:`sig`, :g:`sigT2`, and :g:`sig2`, and there are similar :g:`eq_sig`
   :g:`***_rect` induction lemmas.

.. example::

   *Non-dependent inversion*.

   Let us consider the relation :g:`Le` over natural numbers:

   .. coqtop:: reset in

      Inductive Le : nat -> nat -> Set :=
      | LeO : forall n:nat, Le 0 n
      | LeS : forall n m:nat, Le n m -> Le (S n) (S m).


   Let us consider the following goal:

   .. coqtop:: none

      Section Section.
      Variable P : nat -> nat -> Prop.
      Variable Q : forall n m:nat, Le n m -> Prop.
      Goal forall n m, Le (S n) m -> P n m.

   .. coqtop:: out

      intros.

   To prove the goal, we may need to reason by cases on :g:`H` and to derive
   that :g:`m` is necessarily of the form :g:`(S m0)` for certain :g:`m0` and that
   :g:`(Le n m0)`. Deriving these conditions corresponds to proving that the only
   possible constructor of :g:`(Le (S n) m)` is :g:`LeS` and that we can invert
   the arrow in the type of :g:`LeS`. This inversion is possible because :g:`Le`
   is the smallest set closed by the constructors :g:`LeO` and :g:`LeS`.

   .. coqtop:: all

      inversion_clear H.

   Note that :g:`m` has been substituted in the goal for :g:`(S m0)` and that the
   hypothesis :g:`(Le n m0)` has been added to the context.

   Sometimes it is interesting to have the equality :g:`m = (S m0)` in the
   context to use it after. In that case we can use :tacn:`inversion` that does
   not clear the equalities:

   .. coqtop:: none restart

      intros.

   .. coqtop:: all

      inversion H.

.. example::

   *Dependent inversion.*

   Let us consider the following goal:

   .. coqtop:: none

      Abort.
      Goal forall n m (H:Le (S n) m), Q (S n) m H.

   .. coqtop:: out

      intros.

   As :g:`H` occurs in the goal, we may want to reason by cases on its
   structure and so, we would like inversion tactics to substitute :g:`H` by
   the corresponding @term in constructor form. Neither :tacn:`inversion` nor
   :tacn:`inversion_clear` do such a substitution. To have such a behavior we
   use the dependent inversion tactics:

   .. coqtop:: all

      dependent inversion_clear H.

   Note that :g:`H` has been substituted by :g:`(LeS n m0 l)` and :g:`m` by :g:`(S m0)`.

.. example::

   *Using inversion_sigma.*

   Let us consider the following inductive type of
   length-indexed lists, and a lemma about inverting equality of cons:

   .. coqtop:: reset all

      Require Import Coq.Logic.Eqdep_dec.

      Inductive vec A : nat -> Type :=
      | nil : vec A O
      | cons {n} (x : A) (xs : vec A n) : vec A (S n).

      Lemma invert_cons : forall A n x xs y ys,
               @cons A n x xs = @cons A n y ys
               -> xs = ys.

      Proof.
      intros A n x xs y ys H.

   After performing inversion, we are left with an equality of existTs:

   .. coqtop:: all

      inversion H.

   We can turn this equality into a usable form with inversion_sigma:

   .. coqtop:: all

      inversion_sigma.

   To finish cleaning up the proof, we will need to use the fact that
   that all proofs of n = n for n a nat are eq_refl:

   .. coqtop:: all

      let H := match goal with H : n = n |- _ => H end in
      pose proof (Eqdep_dec.UIP_refl_nat _ H); subst H.
      simpl in *.

   Finally, we can finish the proof:

   .. coqtop:: all

      assumption.
      Qed.

.. seealso:: :tacn:`functional inversion`

.. tacn:: fix @ident @natural
   :name: fix

   This tactic is a primitive tactic to start a proof by induction. In
   general, it is easier to rely on higher-level induction tactics such
   as the ones described in :tacn:`induction`.

   In the syntax of the tactic, the identifier :n:`@ident` is the name given to
   the induction hypothesis. The natural number :n:`@natural` tells on which
   premise of the current goal the induction acts, starting from 1,
   counting both dependent and non dependent products, but skipping local
   definitions. Especially, the current lemma must be composed of at
   least :n:`@natural` products.

   Like in a fix expression, the induction hypotheses have to be used on
   structurally smaller arguments. The verification that inductive proof
   arguments are correct is done only at the time of registering the
   lemma in the global environment. To know if the use of induction hypotheses
   is correct at some time of the interactive development of a proof, use
   the command ``Guarded`` (see Section :ref:`requestinginformation`).

.. tacv:: fix @ident @natural with {+ (@ident {+ @binder} [{struct @ident}] : @type)}

   This starts a proof by mutual induction. The statements to be simultaneously
   proved are respectively :g:`forall binder ... binder, type`.
   The identifiers :n:`@ident` are the names of the induction hypotheses. The identifiers
   :n:`@ident` are the respective names of the premises on which the induction
   is performed in the statements to be simultaneously proved (if not given, the
   system tries to guess itself what they are).

.. tacn:: cofix @ident
   :name: cofix

   This tactic starts a proof by coinduction. The identifier :n:`@ident` is the
   name given to the coinduction hypothesis. Like in a cofix expression,
   the use of induction hypotheses have to guarded by a constructor. The
   verification that the use of co-inductive hypotheses is correct is
   done only at the time of registering the lemma in the global environment. To
   know if the use of coinduction hypotheses is correct at some time of
   the interactive development of a proof, use the command ``Guarded``
   (see Section :ref:`requestinginformation`).

.. tacv:: cofix @ident with {+ (@ident {+ @binder} : @type)}

   This starts a proof by mutual coinduction. The statements to be
   simultaneously proved are respectively :g:`forall binder ... binder, type`
   The identifiers :n:`@ident` are the names of the coinduction hypotheses.

Equality and inductive sets
---------------------------

We describe in this section some special purpose tactics dealing with
equality and inductive sets or types. These tactics use the
equality :g:`eq:forall (A:Type), A->A->Prop`, simply written with the infix
symbol :g:`=`.

.. tacn:: decide equality
   :name: decide equality

   This tactic solves a goal of the form :g:`forall x y : R, {x = y} + {~ x = y}`,
   where :g:`R` is an inductive type such that its constructors do not take
   proofs or functions as arguments, nor objects in dependent types. It
   solves goals of the form :g:`{x = y} + {~ x = y}` as well.

.. tacn:: compare @term @term
   :name: compare

   This tactic compares two given objects :n:`@term` and :n:`@term` of an
   inductive datatype. If :g:`G` is the current goal, it leaves the sub-
   goals :n:`@term =@term -> G` and :n:`~ @term = @term -> G`. The type of
   :n:`@term` and :n:`@term` must satisfy the same restrictions as in the
   tactic ``decide equality``.

.. tacn:: simplify_eq @term
   :name: simplify_eq

   Let :n:`@term` be the proof of a statement of conclusion :n:`@term = @term`.
   If :n:`@term` and :n:`@term` are structurally different (in the sense
   described for the tactic :tacn:`discriminate`), then the tactic
   ``simplify_eq`` behaves as :n:`discriminate @term`, otherwise it behaves as
   :n:`injection @term`.

.. note::
   If some quantified hypothesis of the goal is named :n:`@ident`,
   then :n:`simplify_eq @ident` first introduces the hypothesis in the local
   context using :n:`intros until @ident`.

.. tacv:: simplify_eq @natural

   This does the same thing as :n:`intros until @natural` then
   :n:`simplify_eq @ident` where :n:`@ident` is the identifier for the last
   introduced hypothesis.

.. tacv:: simplify_eq @term with @bindings

   This does the same as :n:`simplify_eq @term` but using the given bindings to
   instantiate parameters or hypotheses of :n:`@term`.

.. tacv:: esimplify_eq @natural
          esimplify_eq @term {? with @bindings}
   :name: esimplify_eq; _

   This works the same as :tacn:`simplify_eq` but if the type of :n:`@term`, or the
   type of the hypothesis referred to by :n:`@natural`, has uninstantiated
   parameters, these parameters are left as existential variables.

.. tacv:: simplify_eq

   If the current goal has form :g:`t1 <> t2`, it behaves as
   :n:`intro @ident; simplify_eq @ident`.

.. tacn:: dependent rewrite -> @ident
   :name: dependent rewrite ->

   This tactic applies to any goal. If :n:`@ident` has type
   :g:`(existT B a b)=(existT B a' b')` in the local context (i.e. each
   :n:`@term` of the equality has a sigma type :g:`{ a:A & (B a)}`) this tactic
   rewrites :g:`a` into :g:`a'` and :g:`b` into :g:`b'` in the current goal.
   This tactic works even if :g:`B` is also a sigma type. This kind of
   equalities between dependent pairs may be derived by the
   :tacn:`injection` and :tacn:`inversion` tactics.

.. tacv:: dependent rewrite <- @ident
   :name: dependent rewrite <-

   Analogous to :tacn:`dependent rewrite ->` but uses the equality from right to
   left.

.. _proofschemes-induction-principles:

Generation of induction principles with ``Scheme``
--------------------------------------------------------

.. cmd:: Scheme {? @ident := } @scheme_kind {* with {? @ident := } @scheme_kind }

   .. insertprodn scheme_kind sort_family

   .. prodn::
      scheme_kind ::= Equality for @reference
      | {| Induction | Minimality | Elimination | Case } for @reference Sort @sort_family
      sort_family ::= Set
      | Prop
      | SProp
      | Type

  A high-level tool for automatically generating
  (possibly mutual) induction principles for given types and sorts.
  Each :n:`@reference` is a different inductive type identifier belonging to
  the same package of mutual inductive definitions.
  The command generates the :n:`@ident`\s as mutually recursive
  definitions. Each term :n:`@ident` proves a general principle of mutual
  induction for objects in type :n:`@reference`.

  :n:`@ident`
    The name of the scheme. If not provided, the scheme name will be determined automatically
    from the sorts involved.

  :n:`Minimality for @reference Sort @sort_family`
    Defines a non-dependent elimination principle more natural for inductively defined relations.

  :n:`Equality for @reference`
     Tries to generate a Boolean equality and a proof of the decidability of the usual equality.
     If :token:`reference` involves other inductive types, their equality has to be defined first.

.. example::

   Induction scheme for tree and forest.

   A mutual induction principle for tree and forest in sort ``Set`` can be defined using the command

    .. coqtop:: reset none

       Axiom A : Set.
       Axiom B : Set.

    .. coqtop:: all

     Inductive tree : Set := node : A -> forest -> tree
     with forest : Set :=
         leaf : B -> forest
       | cons : tree -> forest -> forest.

     Scheme tree_forest_rec := Induction for tree Sort Set
       with forest_tree_rec := Induction for forest Sort Set.

  You may now look at the type of tree_forest_rec:

  .. coqtop:: all

    Check tree_forest_rec.

  This principle involves two different predicates for trees andforests;
  it also has three premises each one corresponding to a constructor of
  one of the inductive definitions.

  The principle `forest_tree_rec` shares exactly the same premises, only
  the conclusion now refers to the property of forests.

.. example::

  Predicates odd and even on naturals.

  Let odd and even be inductively defined as:

   .. coqtop:: all

      Inductive odd : nat -> Prop := oddS : forall n:nat, even n -> odd (S n)
      with even : nat -> Prop :=
        | evenO : even 0
        | evenS : forall n:nat, odd n -> even (S n).

  The following command generates a powerful elimination principle:

   .. coqtop:: all

    Scheme odd_even := Minimality for odd Sort Prop
    with even_odd := Minimality for even Sort Prop.

  The type of odd_even for instance will be:

  .. coqtop:: all

    Check odd_even.

  The type of `even_odd` shares the same premises but the conclusion is
  `(n:nat)(even n)->(P0 n)`.


Automatic declaration of schemes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. flag:: Elimination Schemes

   Enables automatic declaration of induction principles when defining a new
   inductive type.  Defaults to on.

.. flag:: Nonrecursive Elimination Schemes

   Enables automatic declaration of induction principles for types declared with the :cmd:`Variant` and
   :cmd:`Record` commands.  Defaults to off.

.. flag:: Case Analysis Schemes

   This flag governs the generation of case analysis lemmas for inductive types,
   i.e. corresponding to the pattern matching term alone and without fixpoint.

.. flag:: Boolean Equality Schemes
          Decidable Equality Schemes

   These flags control the automatic declaration of those Boolean equalities (see
   the second variant of ``Scheme``).

.. warning::

   You have to be careful with these flags since Coq may now reject well-defined
   inductive types because it cannot compute a Boolean equality for them.

.. flag:: Rewriting Schemes

   This flag governs generation of equality-related schemes such as congruence.

Combined Scheme
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. cmd:: Combined Scheme @ident__def from {+, @ident }

   This command is a tool for combining induction principles generated
   by the :cmd:`Scheme` command.
   Each :n:`@ident` is a different inductive principle that must  belong
   to the same package of mutual inductive principle definitions.
   This command generates :n:`@ident__def` as the conjunction of the
   principles: it is built from the common premises of the principles
   and concluded by the conjunction of their conclusions.
   In the case where all the inductive principles used are in sort
   ``Prop``, the propositional conjunction ``and`` is used, otherwise
   the simple product ``prod`` is used instead.

.. example::

  We can define the induction principles for trees and forests using:

  .. coqtop:: all

    Scheme tree_forest_ind := Induction for tree Sort Prop
    with forest_tree_ind := Induction for forest Sort Prop.

  Then we can build the combined induction principle which gives the
  conjunction of the conclusions of each individual principle:

  .. coqtop:: all

    Combined Scheme tree_forest_mutind from tree_forest_ind,forest_tree_ind.

  The type of tree_forest_mutind will be:

  .. coqtop:: all

    Check tree_forest_mutind.

.. example::

   We can also combine schemes at sort ``Type``:

  .. coqtop:: all

     Scheme tree_forest_rect := Induction for tree Sort Type
     with forest_tree_rect := Induction for forest Sort Type.

  .. coqtop:: all

     Combined Scheme tree_forest_mutrect from tree_forest_rect, forest_tree_rect.

  .. coqtop:: all

     Check tree_forest_mutrect.

.. _derive-inversion:

Generation of inversion principles with ``Derive`` ``Inversion``
-----------------------------------------------------------------

.. cmd:: Derive Inversion @ident with @one_term {? Sort @sort_family }

   Generates an inversion lemma for the
   :tacn:`inversion ... using ...` tactic.  :token:`ident` is the name
   of the generated lemma.  :token:`one_term` should be in the form
   :token:`qualid` or :n:`(forall {+ @binder }, @qualid @term)` where
   :token:`qualid` is the name of an inductive
   predicate and :n:`{+ @binder }` binds the variables occurring in the term
   :token:`term`. The lemma is generated for the sort
   :token:`sort_family` corresponding to :token:`one_term`.
   Applying the lemma is equivalent to inverting the instance with the
   :tacn:`inversion` tactic.

.. cmd:: Derive Inversion_clear @ident with @one_term {? Sort @sort_family }

   When applied, it is equivalent to having inverted the instance with the
   tactic inversion replaced by the tactic `inversion_clear`.

.. cmd:: Derive Dependent Inversion @ident with @one_term Sort @sort_family

   When applied, it is equivalent to having inverted the instance with
   the tactic `dependent inversion`.

.. cmd:: Derive Dependent Inversion_clear @ident with @one_term Sort @sort_family

   When applied, it is equivalent to having inverted the instance
   with the tactic `dependent inversion_clear`.

.. example::

  Consider the relation `Le` over natural numbers and the following
  parameter ``P``:

  .. coqtop:: all

    Inductive Le : nat -> nat -> Set :=
    | LeO : forall n:nat, Le 0 n
    | LeS : forall n m:nat, Le n m -> Le (S n) (S m).

    Parameter P : nat -> nat -> Prop.

  To generate the inversion lemma for the instance :g:`(Le (S n) m)` and the
  sort :g:`Prop`, we do:

  .. coqtop:: all

    Derive Inversion_clear leminv with (forall n m:nat, Le (S n) m) Sort Prop.
    Check leminv.

  Then we can use the proven inversion lemma:

  .. the original LaTeX did not have any Coq code to setup the goal

  .. coqtop:: none

    Goal forall (n m : nat) (H : Le (S n) m), P n m.
    intros.

  .. coqtop:: all

    Show.

    inversion H using leminv.
