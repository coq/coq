Program extraction
==================

:Authors: Jean-Christophe Filli√¢tre and Pierre Letouzey

We present here the Coq extraction commands, used to build certified
and relatively efficient functional programs, extracting them from
either Coq functions or Coq proofs of specifications. The
functional languages available as output are currently OCaml, Haskell
and Scheme. In the following, "ML" will be used (abusively) to refer
to any of the three.

.. versionchanged:: 8.11

   Before using any of the commands or options described in this chapter,
   the extraction framework should first be loaded explicitly
   via ``Require Extraction``, or via the more robust
   ``From Stdlib Require Extraction``.

.. coqtop:: in

   Require Extraction.

Generating ML Code
-------------------

.. note::

  In the following, a qualified identifier :token:`qualid`
  can be used to refer to any kind of Coq global "object" : :term:`constant`,
  inductive type, inductive constructor or module name.

.. cmd:: Extraction @qualid
         Recursive Extraction {+ @qualid }
         Extraction @string {+ @qualid }

   The first two forms display the extracted term(s) in Coq as a convenient preview
   of the extracted term(s):

   - the first form extracts :n:`@qualid` and displays the resulting term;
   - the second form extracts the listed :n:`@qualid`\s and all their
     dependencies, and displays the resulting terms.

   The third form produces a single extraction file named :n:`@string`
   for all the specified objects and all of their dependencies.

   Global and local identifiers are renamed as needed to fulfill the syntactic
   requirements of the target language, keeping original
   names as much as possible.

The following commands also generate file(s). The generated file(s) are
produced in the current working directory. It is possible to inspect what
is the current directory with the command :cmd:`Pwd` and to change it with
the command :cmd:`Cd`.
  
.. cmd:: Extraction Library @ident

   Extraction of the whole Coq library :n:`@ident.v` to an ML module
   :n:`@ident.ml`. In case of name clash, identifiers are here renamed
   using prefixes ``coq_``  or ``Coq_`` to ensure a session-independent
   renaming.

.. cmd:: Recursive Extraction Library @ident

   Extraction of the Coq library :n:`@ident.v` and all other modules
   :n:`@ident.v` depends on.

.. cmd:: Separate Extraction {+ @qualid }

   Recursive extraction of all the mentioned objects and all
   their dependencies, just as :n:`Extraction @string {+ @qualid }`,
   but instead of producing one monolithic file, this command splits
   the produced code in separate ML files, one per corresponding Coq
   ``.v`` file. This command is hence quite similar to
   :cmd:`Recursive Extraction Library`, except that only the needed
   parts of Coq libraries are extracted instead of the whole.
   The naming convention in case of name clash is the same one as
   :cmd:`Extraction Library`: identifiers are here renamed using prefixes
   ``coq_``  or ``Coq_``.

The following command is meant to help automatic testing of
the extraction, see for instance the ``test-suite`` directory
in the Coq sources.

.. cmd:: Extraction TestCompile {+ @qualid }

   All the mentioned objects and all their dependencies are extracted
   to a temporary OCaml file, just as in ``Extraction "file"``. Then
   this temporary file and its signature are compiled with the same
   OCaml compiler used to built Coq. This command succeeds only
   if the extraction and the OCaml compilation succeed. It fails
   if the current target language of the extraction is not OCaml.

.. cmd:: Show Extraction
   :undocumented:

.. cmd:: Pwd

   This command displays the current working directory (where the extracted
   files are produced).

.. cmd:: Cd {? @string }

   .. deprecated:: 8.20

      Use the command line option :n:`-output-directory` instead (see
      :ref:`command-line-options`), or the :opt:`Extraction Output Directory`
      option.

   If :n:`@string` is specified, changes the current directory according to
   :token:`string` which can be any valid path.  Otherwise, it displays the
   current directory as :cmd:`Pwd` does.

Extraction Options
-------------------

Setting the target language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. cmd:: Extraction Language @language

   .. insertprodn language language

   .. prodn::
      language ::= OCaml
      | Haskell
      | Scheme
      | JSON

   The ability to fix target language is the first and most important
   of the extraction options. Default is ``OCaml``.

   The JSON output is mostly for development or debugging:
   it contains the raw ML term produced as an intermediary target.


Inlining and optimizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since OCaml is a strict language, the extracted code has to
be optimized in order to be efficient (for instance, when using
induction principles we do not want to compute all the recursive calls
but only the needed ones). So the extraction mechanism provides an
automatic optimization routine that will be called each time the user
wants to generate an OCaml program. The optimizations can be split in two
groups: the type-preserving ones (essentially constant inlining and
reductions) and the non-type-preserving ones (some function
abstractions of dummy types are removed when it is deemed safe in order
to have more elegant types). Therefore some :term:`constants <constant>` may not appear in the
resulting monolithic OCaml program. In the case of modular extraction,
even if some inlining is done, the inlined constants are nevertheless
printed, to ensure session-independent programs.

Concerning Haskell, type-preserving optimizations are less useful
because of laziness. We still make some optimizations, for example in
order to produce more readable code.

The type-preserving optimizations are controlled by the following Coq flags
and commands:

.. flag:: Extraction Optimize

   Default is on. This :term:`flag` controls all type-preserving optimizations made on
   the ML terms (mostly reduction of dummy beta/iota redexes, but also
   simplifications on Cases, etc). Turn this flag off if you want a
   ML term as close as possible to the Coq term.

.. flag:: Extraction Conservative Types

   Default is off. This :term:`flag` controls the non-type-preserving optimizations
   made on ML terms (which try to avoid function abstraction of dummy
   types). Turn this flag on to make sure that ``e:t``
   implies that ``e':t'`` where ``e'`` and ``t'`` are the extracted
   code of ``e`` and ``t`` respectively.

.. flag:: Extraction KeepSingleton

   Default is off. Normally, when the extraction of an inductive type
   produces a singleton type (i.e. a type with only one constructor, and
   only one argument to this constructor), the inductive structure is
   removed and this type is seen as an alias to the inner type.
   The typical example is ``sig``. This :term:`flag` allows disabling this
   optimization when one wishes to preserve the inductive structure of types.

.. flag:: Extraction AutoInline

   Default is off. When enabled, the extraction mechanism inlines the :term:`bodies <body>` of
   some defined :term:`constants <constant>`, according to some heuristics
   like size of bodies, uselessness of some arguments, etc.

   Even when this flag is off, recursors (`_rect` and `_rec` schemes, such as `nat_rect`), projections, and a few
   specific constants such as `andb` and `orb` (for the lazy
   behaviour) and well founded recursion combinators are still
   automatically inlined.

.. cmd:: Extraction Inline {+ @qualid }

   In addition to the automatic inline feature, the :term:`constants <constant>`
   mentioned by this command will always be inlined during extraction.

.. cmd:: Extraction NoInline {+ @qualid }

   Conversely, the constants mentioned by this command will
   never be inlined during extraction.

.. cmd:: Print Extraction Inline

   Prints the current state of the table recording the custom inlinings 
   declared by the two previous commands. 

.. cmd:: Reset Extraction Inline

   Empties the table recording the custom inlinings (see the
   previous commands).

**Inlining and printing of a constant declaration:**

The user can explicitly ask for a :term:`constant` to be extracted by two means:

  * by mentioning it on the extraction command line

  * by extracting the whole Coq module of this :term:`constant`.

In both cases, the declaration of this :term:`constant` will be present in the
produced file. But this same :term:`constant` may or may not be inlined in
the following terms, depending on the automatic/custom inlining mechanism.  

For the :term:`constants <constant>` non-explicitly required but needed for dependency
reasons, there are two cases: 

  * If an inlining decision is taken, whether automatically or not,
    all occurrences of this :term:`constant` are replaced by its extracted :term:`body`,
    and this :term:`constant` is not declared in the generated file.

  * If no inlining decision is taken, the :term:`constant` is normally
    declared in the produced file. 

Extra elimination of useless arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following command provides some extra manual control on the
code elimination performed during extraction, in a way which
is independent but complementary to the main elimination
principles of extraction (logical parts and types).

.. cmd:: Extraction Implicit @qualid [ {* {| @ident | @integer } } ]

   Declares some arguments of
   :token:`qualid` as implicit, meaning that they are useless in extracted code.
   The extracted code will omit these arguments.
   Here :token:`qualid` can be
   any function or inductive constructor, and the :token:`ident`\s are
   the names of the useless arguments.  Arguments can can also be
   identified positionally by :token:`integer`\s starting from 1.

When an actual extraction takes place, an error is normally raised if the
:cmd:`Extraction Implicit` declarations cannot be honored, that is
if any of the implicit arguments still occurs in the final code.
This behavior can be relaxed via the following flag:

.. flag:: Extraction SafeImplicits

   Default is on. When this :term:`flag` is off, a warning is emitted
   instead of an error if some implicit arguments still occur in the
   final code of an extraction. This way, the extracted code may be
   obtained nonetheless and reviewed manually to locate the source of the issue
   (in the code, some comments mark the location of these remaining implicit arguments).
   Note that this extracted code might not compile or run properly,
   depending of the use of these remaining implicit arguments.

Realizing axioms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Extraction will fail if it encounters an informative axiom not realized. 
A warning will be issued if it encounters a logical axiom, to remind the
user that inconsistent logical axioms may lead to incorrect or
non-terminating extracted terms. 

It is possible to assume some axioms while developing a proof. Since
these axioms can be any kind of proposition or object or type, they may
perfectly well have some computational content. But a program must be
a closed term, and of course the system cannot guess the program which
realizes an axiom.  Therefore, it is possible to tell the system
what ML term corresponds to a given axiom. 

.. cmd:: Extract Constant @qualid {* @string__tv } => {| @ident | @string }

   Give an ML extraction for the given :term:`constant`.

   :n:`@string__tv`
     If the type scheme axiom is an arity (a sequence of products followed
     by a sort), then some type
     variables have to be given (as quoted strings).

     The number of type variables is checked by the system. For example:

     .. coqtop:: in

        Axiom Y : Set -> Set -> Set.
        Extract Constant Y "'a" "'b" => " 'a * 'b ".

   .. note::
      The extraction recognizes whether the realized axiom
      should become a ML type constant or a ML object declaration. For example:

      .. coqtop:: in

         Axiom X:Set.
         Axiom x:X.
         Extract Constant X => "int".
         Extract Constant x => "0".

   .. caution:: It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that the ML
      terms given to realize the axioms do have the expected types. In
      fact, the strings containing realizing code are just copied to the
      extracted files.

.. cmd:: Extract Inlined Constant @qualid => {| @ident | @string }

   Same as the previous one, except that the given ML terms will
   be inlined everywhere instead of being declared via a ``let``.

   .. note::
      This command is sugar for an :cmd:`Extract Constant` followed
      by a :cmd:`Extraction Inline`. Hence a :cmd:`Reset Extraction Inline`
      will have an effect on the realized and inlined axiom.

   .. exn:: The term @qualid is already defined as foreign custom constant.

      The :n:`@qualid` was previously used in a
      :cmd:`Extract Foreign Constant` command. Using :cmd:`Extract Inlined Constant`
      for :n:`@qualid` would override this command.


Realizing an axiom via :cmd:`Extract Constant` is only useful in the
case of an informative axiom (of sort ``Type`` or ``Set``). A logical axiom
has no computational content and hence will not appear in extracted
terms. But a warning is nonetheless issued if extraction encounters a
logical axiom. This warning reminds user that inconsistent logical
axioms may lead to incorrect or non-terminating extracted terms.

If an informative axiom has not been realized before an extraction, a
warning is also issued and the definition of the axiom is filled with
an exception labeled ``AXIOM TO BE REALIZED``. The user must then
search these exceptions inside the extracted file and replace them by
real code.

Realizing inductive types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The system also provides a mechanism to specify ML terms for inductive
types and constructors. For instance, the user may want to use the ML
native boolean type instead of the Coq one. The syntax is the following:

.. cmd:: Extract Inductive @qualid => {| @ident | @string } [ {* {| @ident | @string } } ] {? @string__match }

   Give an ML extraction for the given inductive type. You must specify
   extractions for the type itself (the initial :n:`{| @ident | @string }`) and all its
   constructors (the :n:`[ {* {| @ident | @string } } ]`). In this form,
   the ML extraction must be an ML inductive datatype, and the native
   pattern matching of the language will be used.

   When the initial :n:`{| @ident | @string }` matches the name of the type of characters or strings
   (``char`` and ``string`` for OCaml, ``Prelude.Char`` and ``Prelude.String``
   for Haskell), extraction of literals is handled in a specialized way, so as
   to generate literals in the target language. This feature requires the type
   designated by :n:`@qualid` to be registered as the standard char or string type,
   using the :cmd:`Register` command.

   :n:`@string__match`
     Indicates how to
     perform pattern matching over this inductive type. In this form,
     the ML extraction could be an arbitrary type.
     For an inductive type with :math:`k` constructors, the function used to
     emulate the pattern matching should expect :math:`k+1` arguments, first the :math:`k`
     branches in functional form, and then the inductive element to
     destruct. For instance, the match branch ``| S n => foo`` gives the
     functional form ``(fun n -> foo)``. Note that a constructor with no
     arguments is considered to have one unit argument, in order to block
     early evaluation of the branch: ``| O => bar`` leads to the functional
     form ``(fun () -> bar)``. For instance, when extracting :g:`nat`
     into OCaml ``int``, the code to be provided has type:
     ``(unit->'a)->(int->'a)->int->'a``.

   .. caution:: As for :cmd:`Extract Constant`, this command should be used with care:

     * The ML code provided by the user is currently **not** checked at all by
       extraction, even for syntax errors.

     * Extracting an inductive type to a pre-existing ML inductive type
       is quite sound. But extracting to a general type (by providing an
       ad-hoc pattern matching) will often **not** be fully rigorously
       correct. For instance, when extracting ``nat`` to OCaml ``int``,
       it is theoretically possible to build ``nat`` values that are
       larger than OCaml ``max_int``. It is the user's responsibility to
       be sure that no overflow or other bad events occur in practice.

     * Translating an inductive type to an arbitrary ML type does **not**
       magically improve the asymptotic complexity of functions, even if the
       ML type is an efficient representation. For instance, when extracting
       ``nat`` to OCaml ``int``, the function ``Nat.mul`` stays quadratic.
       It might be interesting to associate this translation with
       some specific :cmd:`Extract Constant` when primitive counterparts exist.

Typical examples are the following:

.. coqtop:: in
    
   Extract Inductive unit => "unit" [ "()" ].
   Extract Inductive bool => "bool" [ "true" "false" ].
   Extract Inductive sumbool => "bool" [ "true" "false" ].

.. note::

   When extracting to OCaml, if an inductive constructor or type has arity 2 and
   the corresponding string is enclosed by parentheses, and the string meets
   OCaml's lexical criteria for an infix symbol, then the rest of the string is
   used as an infix constructor or type.

.. coqtop:: in
   
   Extract Inductive list => "list" [ "[]" "(::)" ].
   Extract Inductive prod => "(*)"  [ "(,)" ].

As an example of translation to a non-inductive datatype, let's turn
``nat`` into OCaml ``int`` (see caveat above):

.. coqtop:: in

   Extract Inductive nat => int [ "0" "succ" ] "(fun fO fS n -> if n=0 then fO () else fS (n-1))".

Generating FFI Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The plugin provides mechanisms to generate only OCaml code to
interface the generated OCaml code with C programs. In order to link compiled
OCaml code with C code, the linker needs to know

   * which C functions will be called by the ML code (external)
   * which ML functions shall be accessible by the C code (callbacks)

.. cmd:: Extract Foreign Constant @qualid => @string

   Like :cmd:`Extract Constant`, except that the referenced ML terms
   will be declared in the form

   ``external`` :n:`@qualid` ``: ML type =`` ":n:`@string`".

   For example:

   .. coqtop:: in

      Require Extraction.
      Require Stdlib.extraction.ExtrOcamlNatInt.
      Axiom f : nat -> nat -> nat.
      Extract Foreign Constant f => "f_impl".

   Here, the extracted external definition will be:

   ``external f : int -> int -> int = "f_impl"``

   .. caution::

      * The external function name :n:`@string` is not checked in any way.

      * The user must ensure that the C functions given to realize the axioms have
        the expected or compatible types. In fact, the strings containing realizing
        code are just copied to the extracted files.

   .. exn:: Extract Foreign Constant is supported only for OCaml extraction.

      Foreign function calls are only supported for OCaml.

   .. exn:: Extract Foreign Constant is supported only for functions.

      This error is thrown if :n:`@qualid` is of sort ``Type`` as external functions only
      work for functions.

   .. exn:: The term @qualid is already defined as inline custom constant.

      The :n:`@qualid` was previously used in a
      :cmd:`Extract Inlined Constant` command. Using :cmd:`Extract Foreign Constant`
      for :n:`@qualid` would override this command.

.. cmd:: Extract Callback {? @string } @qualid

   This command makes sure that after extracting the :term:`constants <constant>`
   specified by :n:`@qualid`, a constant ML function will be generated that
   registers :n:`@qualid` as callback, callable by :n:`@string`.
   This is done by declaring a function
   ``let _ = Callback.register`` ":n:`@string`" :n:`@qualid`.

   This expression signals OCaml that the given ML function :n:`@qualid` shall be
   accessible via the alias :n:`@string`, when calling from C/C++.
   If no alias is specified, it is set to the string representation of :n:`@qualid`.

   .. caution::
      * The optional alias :n:`@string` is currently **not** checked in any way.

      * The user must ensure that the callback aliases are
        unique, i.e. when multiple modules expose a callback, the user should make
        sure that no two :n:`@qualid` share the same alias.

   .. note::
      Using Extract Callback has no impact on the rest of the synthesised code since
      it is an additional declaration. Thus, there is no impact on the correctness
      and type safety of the generated code.

   .. exn:: Extract Callback is supported only for OCaml extraction.

      The callback registration mechanism ``Callback.register`` is specific
      to OCaml. Thus, the command is only usable when extracting OCaml code.

.. cmd:: Print Extraction Foreign

   Prints the current set of custom foreign functions
   declared by the command :cmd:`Extract Foreign Constant` together with its
   associated foreign ML function name.

.. .. cmd:: Reset Extraction Foreign

..   Resets the set of custom externals
..   declared by the command :cmd:`Extract Foreign Constant`.

.. cmd:: Print Extraction Callback

   Prints the map of callbacks
   declared by the command :cmd:`Extract Callback`,
   showing the :token:`qualid` and callback alias
   :token:`string` (if specified) for each callback.

.. cmd:: Reset Extraction Callback

   Resets the the map recording the callbacks
   declared by the command :cmd:`Extract Callback`.


Avoiding conflicts with existing filenames
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using :cmd:`Extraction Library`, the names of the extracted files
directly depend on the names of the Coq files. It may happen that
these filenames are in conflict with already existing files, 
either in the standard library of the target language or in other
code that is meant to be linked with the extracted code. 
For instance the module ``List`` exists both in Coq and in OCaml.
It is possible to instruct the extraction not to use particular filenames.

.. cmd:: Extraction Blacklist {+ @ident }

   Instruct the extraction to avoid using these names as filenames
   for extracted code.

.. cmd:: Print Extraction Blacklist

   Show the current list of filenames the extraction should avoid.

.. cmd:: Reset Extraction Blacklist

   Allow the extraction to use any filename.

For OCaml, a typical use of these commands is
``Extraction Blacklist String List``.

Additional settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. opt:: Extraction File Comment @string

   This :term:`option` provides a comment that is
   included at the beginning of the output files.

.. opt:: Extraction Flag @natural

   This :term:`option` controls which optimizations are used during extraction, providing a finer-grained
   control than :flag:`Extraction Optimize`.  The bits of :token:`natural` are used as a bit mask.
   Keeping an option off keeps the extracted ML more similar to the Coq term.
   Values are:

   +-----+-------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Bit | Value | Optimization (default is on unless noted otherwise)            |
   +-----+-------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
   |   0 |    1  | Remove local dummy variables                                   |

   +-----+-------+----------------------------------------------------------------+

.. flag:: Extraction TypeExpand

   If this :term:`flag` is set, fully expand Coq types in ML.  See the Coq source code to learn more.

.. opt:: Extraction Output Directory @string

   Sets the directory where extracted files will be written. If not set,
   files will be written to the directory specified by the command line
   option :n:`-output-directory`, if set (see :ref:`command-line-options`) and
   otherwise, the current directory.  Use :cmd:`Pwd` to display the current directory.

Differences between Coq and ML type systems
----------------------------------------------

Due to differences between Coq and ML type systems,
some extracted programs are not directly typable in ML. 
We now solve this problem (at least in OCaml) by adding
when needed some unsafe casting ``Obj.magic``, which give
a generic type ``'a`` to any term.

First, if some part of the program is *very* polymorphic, there
may be no ML type for it. In that case the extraction to ML works
alright but the generated code may be refused by the ML
type checker. A very well known example is the ``distr-pair``
function:

.. coqtop:: in

   Definition dp {A B:Type}(x:A)(y:B)(f:forall C:Type, C->C) := (f A x, f B y).

In OCaml, for instance, the direct extracted term would be::

   let dp x y f = Pair((f () x),(f () y))

and would have type::

   dp : 'a -> 'a -> (unit -> 'a -> 'b) -> ('b,'b) prod

which is not its original type, but a restriction.

We now produce the following correct version::

   let dp x y f = Pair ((Obj.magic f () x), (Obj.magic f () y))

Secondly, some Coq definitions may have no counterpart in ML. This
happens when there is a quantification over types inside the type
of a constructor; for example:

.. coqtop:: in

   Inductive anything : Type := dummy : forall A:Set, A -> anything.

which corresponds to the definition of an ML dynamic type.
In OCaml, we must cast any argument of the constructor dummy
(no GADT are produced yet by the extraction).

Even with those unsafe castings, you should never get error like
``segmentation fault``. In fact even if your program may seem
ill-typed to the OCaml type checker, it can't go wrong : it comes
from a Coq well-typed terms, so for example inductive types will always
have the correct number of arguments, etc. Of course, when launching
manually some extracted function, you should apply it to arguments
of the right shape (from the Coq point-of-view).

More details about the correctness of the extracted programs can be 
found in :cite:`Let02`.

We have to say, though, that in most "realistic" programs, these problems do not
occur. For example all the programs of Coq library are accepted by the OCaml
type checker without any ``Obj.magic`` (see examples below).

Some examples
-------------

We present here two examples of extraction, taken from the
Coq Standard Library. We choose OCaml as the target language,
but everything, with slight modifications, can also be done in the
other languages supported by extraction.
We then indicate where to find other examples and tests of extraction.

A detailed example: Euclidean division
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The file ``Euclid`` contains the proof of Euclidean division.
The natural numbers used here are unary, represented by the type ``nat``,
which is defined by two constructors ``O`` and ``S``.
This module contains a theorem ``eucl_dev``, whose type is::

   forall b:nat, b > 0 -> forall a:nat, diveucl a b

where ``diveucl`` is a type for the pair of the quotient and the
modulo, plus some logical assertions that disappear during extraction.
We can now extract this program to OCaml:

.. coqtop:: reset all

   Require Extraction.
   Require Import Euclid Wf_nat.
   Extraction Inline gt_wf_rec lt_wf_rec induction_ltof2.
   Recursive Extraction eucl_dev.

The inlining of ``gt_wf_rec`` and others is not
mandatory. It only enhances readability of extracted code.
You can then copy-paste the output to a file ``euclid.ml`` or let 
Coq do it for you with the following command::

   Extraction "euclid" eucl_dev.

Let us play the resulting program (in an OCaml toplevel)::

   #use "euclid.ml";;
   type nat = O | S of nat
   type sumbool = Left | Right
   val sub : nat -> nat -> nat = <fun>
   val le_lt_dec : nat -> nat -> sumbool = <fun>
   val le_gt_dec : nat -> nat -> sumbool = <fun>
   type diveucl = Divex of nat * nat
   val eucl_dev : nat -> nat -> diveucl = <fun>

   # eucl_dev (S (S O)) (S (S (S (S (S O)))));;
   - : diveucl = Divex (S (S O), S O)

It is easier to test on OCaml integers::

   # let rec nat_of_int = function 0 -> O | n -> S (nat_of_int (n-1));;
   val nat_of_int : int -> nat = <fun>

   # let rec int_of_nat = function O -> 0 | S p -> 1+(int_of_nat p);;
   val int_of_nat : nat -> int = <fun>

   # let div a b = 
     let Divex (q,r) = eucl_dev (nat_of_int b) (nat_of_int a)
     in (int_of_nat q, int_of_nat r);;
   val div : int -> int -> int * int = <fun>

   # div 173 15;;
   - : int * int = (11, 8)

Note that these ``nat_of_int`` and ``int_of_nat`` are now
available via a mere ``Require Import ExtrOcamlIntConv`` and then
adding these functions to the list of functions to extract. This file
``ExtrOcamlIntConv.v`` and some others in ``plugins/extraction/``
are meant to help building concrete program via extraction.

Extraction's horror museum
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some pathological examples of extraction are grouped in the file
``test-suite/success/extraction.v`` of the sources of Coq.

Users' Contributions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Several of the Coq Users' Contributions use extraction to produce
certified programs. In particular the following ones have an automatic
extraction test:

 * ``additions`` : https://github.com/coq-contribs/additions
 * ``bdds`` : https://github.com/coq-contribs/bdds
 * ``canon-bdds`` : https://github.com/coq-contribs/canon-bdds
 * ``chinese`` : https://github.com/coq-contribs/chinese
 * ``continuations`` : https://github.com/coq-contribs/continuations
 * ``coq-in-coq`` : https://github.com/coq-contribs/coq-in-coq
 * ``exceptions`` : https://github.com/coq-contribs/exceptions
 * ``firing-squad`` : https://github.com/coq-contribs/firing-squad
 * ``founify`` : https://github.com/coq-contribs/founify
 * ``graphs`` : https://github.com/coq-contribs/graphs
 * ``higman-cf`` : https://github.com/coq-contribs/higman-cf
 * ``higman-nw`` : https://github.com/coq-contribs/higman-nw
 * ``hardware`` : https://github.com/coq-contribs/hardware

 * ``search-trees`` : https://github.com/coq-contribs/search-trees
 * ``stalmarck`` : https://github.com/coq-contribs/stalmarck

Note that ``continuations`` and ``multiplier`` are a bit particular. They are
examples of developments where ``Obj.magic`` is needed. This is
probably due to a heavy use of impredicativity. After compilation, those
two examples run nonetheless, thanks to the correction of the
extraction :cite:`Let02`.
