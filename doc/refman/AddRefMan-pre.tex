\chapter*{Presentation of the Addendum}

Here you will find several pieces of additional documentation for the
\Coq\ Reference Manual. Each of this chapters is concentrated on a
particular topic, that should interest only a fraction of the \Coq\
users: that's the reason why they are apart from the Reference
Manual.

  generalized pattern-matching. It is contributed by Cristina Cornes

%  manual of the tools he wrote for printing proofs in natural
