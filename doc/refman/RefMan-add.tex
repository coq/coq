\section[Tutorials]{Tutorials\label{Tutorial}}
A companion volume to this reference manual, the \Coq\ Tutorial, is
aimed at gently introducing new users to developing proofs in \Coq\
without assuming prior knowledge of type theory. In a second step, the
user can read also the tutorial on recursive types (document {\tt
RecTutorial.ps}).

\section[The \Coq\ standard library]{The \Coq\ standard library\label{Addoc-library}}
A brief description of the \Coq\ standard library is given in the additional
document {\tt Library.dvi}.

\section[Installation and un-installation procedures]{Installation and un-installation procedures\label{Addoc-install}}
A \verb!INSTALL! file in the distribution explains how to install
\Coq.

\section[{\tt Extraction} of programs]{{\tt Extraction} of programs\label{Addoc-extract}}
{\tt Extraction} is a package offering some special facilities to
extract ML program files. It is described in the separate document
{\tt Extraction.dvi}
\index{Extraction of programs}

\section[Proof printing in {\tt Natural} language]{Proof printing in {\tt Natural} language\label{Addoc-natural}}
{\tt Natural} is a tool to print proofs in natural language.
It is described in the separate document {\tt Natural.dvi}.

\section[The {\tt Omega} decision tactic]{The {\tt Omega} decision tactic\label{Addoc-omega}}
{\bf Omega} is a tactic to automatically solve arithmetical goals in
Presburger arithmetic (i.e. arithmetic without multiplication). 
It is described in the separate document {\tt Omega.dvi}.
\index{Omega@{\tt Omega}}

\section[Simplification on rings]{Simplification on rings\label{Addoc-polynom}}
A documentation of the package {\tt polynom} (simplification on rings)
can be found in the document {\tt Polynom.dvi}
\index{Polynom@{\tt Polynom}}
\index{Simplification on rings}

%\section[Anomalies]{Anomalies\label{Addoc-anomalies}}
%The separate document {\tt Anomalies.*} gives a list of known
%anomalies and bugs of the system.  Before communicating us an
%anomalous behavior, please check first whether it has been already
%reported in this document.
