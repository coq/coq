(** [findlib_resolve ~meta_files ~file ~package ~plugin_name] tries to locate
    a [.cmxs] for a given [package.plugin_name].

    If a [META] file for [package] is found, it will try to use it to resolve
    the path to the [.cmxs], and return a relative path to both. If not, it
    errors.

    The [META] file for [package] is first searched in the [meta_files] list,
    and if it is not found then [Findlib.package_meta_file] is used. note that
    coqdep does not initialize findlib, so that function performs implicity
    initialization. *)
