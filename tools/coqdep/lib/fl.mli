(** [findlib_deep_resolve ~file ~package] tries to locate
    a [.cmxs] for a given [package]. It also searches for its dependencies.

    Dependencies of coq-core.toplevel (i.e. coqc) are ignored.

    [file] is used for error messages.

    If a [META] file for [package] is found, it will try to use it to resolve
    the path to the [.cmxs], and return a relative path to both. If not, it
    errors. *)
