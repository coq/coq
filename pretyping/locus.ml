(** {6 Abstract clauses expressions}

  A [clause_expr] (and its instance [clause]) denotes occurrences and
  hypotheses in a goal in an abstract way; in particular, it can refer
  to the set of all hypotheses independently of the effective contents
  of the current goal

  Concerning the field [onhyps]:
   - [None] means *on every hypothesis*
   - [Some l] means on hypothesis belonging to l *)

(** [clause_atom] refers either to an hypothesis location (i.e. an
   hypothesis with occurrences and a position, in body if any, in type
   or in both) or to some occurrences of the conclusion *)

(** A [hyp_location] is an hypothesis together with a location *)

    or the conclusion (represented by None) *)

(** A [simple_clause] is a set of hypotheses, possibly extended with
   the conclusion (conclusion is represented by None) *)
