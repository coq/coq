THE COQ V8.1 SYSTEM
===================

    This file contains remarks specific to the windows port of Coq.

INSTALLATION.
=============

    See the file INSTALL.win for installation procedure.

COMPILATION.
============

    If you want to install coq, you had better transfer the precompiled
    distribution. If you really need to recompile under Windows, here
    are some indications:

    1- Install ocaml version 3.07 or later, Visual C++ (needed
       for the -custom option of ocaml) and MASM (needed if you want
       to produce a native version).

    2- Install a complete set of Unix utilities (used by Makefiles). 
       See: http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/.

    3- Under cygwin, type successively

        ./configure
        make world
        make install
        make clean

    4- Though not nescessary, you can find useful:
         - Windows version of (X)Emacs: it is a powerful environment for
           developpers with coloured syntax, modes for compilation and debug,
           and many more. It is free. See: http://www.gnu.org/software.
         - Windows cvs client (very useful if you have access to the Coq
           archive).

    If you are lost, you could find help at: coq-bugs@pauillac.inria.fr.

    Good luck :-)
