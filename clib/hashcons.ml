(* Hash consing of datastructures *)

(* [t] is the type of object to hash-cons
 * [u] is the type of hash-cons functions for the sub-structures
 *   of objects of type t (u usually has the form (t1->t1)*(t2->t2)*...).
 * [hashcons u x] is a function that hash-cons the sub-structures of x using
 *   the hash-consing functions u provides.
 * [eq] is a comparison function. It is allowed to use physical equality
 *   on the sub-terms hash-consed by the hashcons function.
 * [hash] is the hash function given to the Hashtbl.Make function
 *
 * Note that this module type coerces to the argument of Hashtbl.Make.
 *)

  sig
    type t

    val hashcons :  u -> t -> t
    val eq : t -> t -> bool

  end

(** The output is a function [generate] such that [generate args] creates a
    hash-table of the hash-consed objects, together with [hcons], a function
    taking a table and an object, and hashcons it. For simplicity of use, we use
    the wrapper functions defined below. *)

     * An invariant is that the table never contains two entries equals
