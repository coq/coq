			CoqIde Installation procedure.

CoqIde is a graphical interface to perform interactive proofs.
You should be able to do everything you do in coqtop inside CoqIde 
excepted dropping to the ml toplevel.

DISCLAIMER: CoqIde is ongoing work. Eventhough it should never let you
	    loose a proof, you may encounter unexpected bugs.
 	    Do not hesitate to send suggestions/bug reports.

REQUIREMENT:
	- OCaml >= 3.06 with native thread support.
	- make world must succeed.
	- The graphical toolkit Gtk 2.x. See http://www.gtk.org.
	  The official supported version is at least 2.2.x.
	  You may still compile CoqIde with older 2.0.x versions and 
          use all features.
	  Run 
		"pkg-config --modversion gtk+-2.0"
	  to check your version.
	 All recent distributions have precompiled packages.
	 Do not forget to install the developement headers packages.
	 As for Debian/woody, 
		apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev 
	 should be enough.

INSTALLATION
 0) For optimal performance, OCaml must support native threads (aka pthreads). 
    If this not the case, this means that Coq computations will be slow and 
    "make ide" will fail. Use "make bin/coqide.byte" instead. To fix this 
    problem, just recompile OCaml from source and configure OCaml with : 
	"./configure --with-pthreads". 
    In case you install over an existing copy of OCaml, you should better 
    empty the OCaml installation directory.

 1) You need to install the OCaml stub library lablgtk2. See 
       	http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/lablgtk.html
    The first official release of lablftk2 is here:
	http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/dist/lablgtk-2.2.0.tar.gz
    Note that even if its README requires ocaml > 3.07, it works ok with 3.06.
    If you are in a hurry just run :
    
cd /tmp && \
wget \
 http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/dist/lablgtk-2.2.0.tar.gz && \
tar zxvf lablgtk-2.2.0.tar.gz && \
cd lablgtk-2.2.0 && \
./configure && \
make world && \
make install

   You must have write access to the OCaml standard library path.
   If this fails read lablgtk-2.2.0/README.

2) Go into your Coq source directory and, as usual, configure with:

	./configure

   This should detect the ability of making CoqIde.
   Then compile with

	make world

   and install with

	make install

   In case you are upgrading from an old version you may need to run
	make clean-ide

3) You may now run bin/coqide


NOTES
There are three configuration files located in your $(HOME) dir. 
 You may need to set HOME to some sensible value under Windows.

- .coqiderc is generated by coqide itself. It may be edited by hand or 
  by using the Preference menu from coqide. It will be generated the first time
  you save your the preferences in Coqide.

- .coqide-gtk2rc is a standard Gtk2 configuration file. A sample file can be
  found in the coq lib "ide" subdir.

- .coqide.keys is a standard Gtk2 accelerator dump. You may edit this file 
  to change the default shortcuts for the menus.
