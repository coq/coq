synopsis: "The Rocq Prover -- Core Binaries and Tools"
description: """
The Rocq Prover is an interactive theorem prover, or proof assistant. It provides
a formal language to write mathematical definitions, executable
algorithms and theorems together with an environment for
semi-interactive development of machine-checked proofs.

Typical applications include the certification of properties of
programming languages (e.g. the CompCert compiler certification
project, or the Bedrock verified low-level programming library), the
formalization of mathematics (e.g. the full formalization of the
Feit-Thompson theorem or homotopy type theory) and teaching.

This package includes the Rocq Prover core binaries, plugins, and tools, but
not the vernacular standard library.

Note that in this setup, Rocq needs to be started with the -boot and
-noinit options, as will otherwise fail to find the regular Rocq
prelude, now living in the rocq-core package."""
