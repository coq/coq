(* The toplevel parsing loop we propose here is more robust to printing
   errors.  The philosophy is that all commands should be individually wrapped
   in predefined markers.  If there is a parsing error, everything down to
   the closing marker will be discarded.  Also there is always an aknowledge
   message associated to a wrapped command. *)


(* It is also possible to have break signals sent by other programs.  However,
   there are some operations that should not be interrupted, especially, those
   operations that are outputing data.
