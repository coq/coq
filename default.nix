# How to use?

# If you have Nix installed, you can get in an environment with everything
# needed to compile Coq and CoqIDE by running:
# $ nix-shell
# at the root of the Coq repository.

# How to tweak default arguments?

# nix-shell supports the --arg option (see Nix doc) that allows you for
# instance to do this:
# $ nix-shell --arg ocamlPackages "(import <nixpkgs> {}).ocaml-ng.ocamlPackages_4_05" --arg buildIde false

# You can also compile Coq and "install" it by running:
# $ make clean # (only needed if you have left-over compilation files)
# $ nix-build
# at the root of the Coq repository.
# nix-build also supports the --arg option, so you will be able to do:
# $ nix-build --arg doInstallCheck false
# if you want to speed up things by not running the test-suite.
# Once the build is finished, you will find, in the current directory,
# a symlink to where Coq was installed.
