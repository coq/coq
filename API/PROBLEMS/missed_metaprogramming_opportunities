Existing metaprogramming mechanisms provided by Ocaml
may enable us to shrink the size of the API.
There are many API elements that can be generated
(instead of manually defined).

INSTANCES

Consider the possibility to *generate* functions like:
- Term.isRel
- Term.isMeta
- Term.isCoFix
- ...
instead of implementing them explicitely.
(what would we then do with "DestKO" exception?)
