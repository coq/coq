If "M.t" is a type that represents some kind of collection of things
then "M.empty" usually represents an "empty collection" of that kind.

The type of the "M.empty" function usually is:

  M.t

or perhaps

  'a M.t

Supporting examples (from the Ocaml standard library):
- Map.empty
- Queue.empty
- Set.empty

Conflicting examples (from the Ocaml standard library):
- List.nil
  (In this case, instead of Ocaml tradition, we follow LISP tradition ?!)
