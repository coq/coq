Decide how we want to create module names composed from multiple words.
- use "CamelCase" ?
- use underscore ?
It would probably make sense to follow the tradition of the Ocaml standard library (which is also followed by Batteries).

================================================================================

INSTANCES
- Termops vs Constrexpr_ops
  (why did we insert '_' in the second identifier?)
- Map
  - Names.Cmap
    (consider moving it to "Names.Constant.Map")
  - Names.MPmap
    (consider moving it to "Names.ModPath.Map")
- Set
  - Names.Cset
    (consider moving it to "Names.Constant.Set")
  - Names.MPset
    (consider moving it to "Names.ModPath.Set")
  - Globnames.Refset
    (consider moving it to "Globnames.Set")
  - Globnames.Refmap
    (consider moving it to "Globnames.Map")
- ...
