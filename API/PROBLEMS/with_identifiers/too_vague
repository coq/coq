Some of the identifiers are not completely wrong,
but they are neither fully satisfactory.
That is, the actual identifier is too vague/imprecise concerning the actual meaning
of a given API element.

================================================================================

INSTANCES:

- names of modules
  - Libnames
    (The name is not entirely helpful although the right solution
     (instead of trying to find a better name)
     might be to dissolute this module completely.)
  - Libobject
    (The "Lib" and "object" parts of the identifier are too vague.)
  - Summary
    (The "Summary" part of the identifier is too vague.)
  - Summary.Local
    (The "Local" part of the identifier is too vague.)
- names of types
  - Libnames.object_name
    (The "object" part of the identifier is too vague.)
- names of functions
  - Termops.is_global
    (The "global" part of the identifier is too vague.)
