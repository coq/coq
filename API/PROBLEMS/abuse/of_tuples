Where we use tuples, we should consider using records.

Benefits:
- by looking at the type definition, the reader gets more hints about the meanings of individual fields
- by looking at record values, the reader gets
  - more hints about the *type* of the value that is begin constructed/destructed
  - as well as more hints about the *meanings* of individual fields
