Some API properties can be reliably maintained only if we write
helper scripts.

================================================================================

INSTACES
- We need a script that will be able to go though the current version of the API
  and report:
  - all elements present in the API but not used by the plugins
    (we are concerned with)
  - all type definitions that are transparent but could be made opaque
    ("non-polymorphic" (i.e. typed-by-name) variants, GADT, records)
    - examples (of API elements that can be made abstract)
      - API.Names.tableKey
      - API.Cbytecodes.reloc_table
- We need a script that will be able to detect and report all such API elements,
  that are mere aliases of existing API elements.
- If API contains an element that is an alias of some other element
  in the Coq codebase, but it is not original (only an alias)
  we need a script that will detect and report these cases.
  Ultimately, API should alias only originals, not aliases.
