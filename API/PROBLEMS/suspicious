Surprising things that are present in the current API.

================================================================================

INSTANCES:

- Why do plugins need these things:
  - Env.empty_env
    (Why do the plugins need to create new global environment?)
  - Tacmach.New.of_old
  - Term.pop
  - Term.kind_of_term.Evar
    (The fact tht we have "Evar" variant in EConstr is perfectly clear.
     Why we have this variant also in the Term, is somewhat suspicious.)

- Why does anyone need to use values of type "evar_map ref"?
  - Evd.evd_comb*
  - Evarconv.e_conv
  - Evarutil.clear_hyps_in_evi
  - Constrintern.interp_context_evars
  - Constrintern.interp_constr_evars
  - Constrintern.interp_type_evars
  - Typing.e_type_of
  - ...

- Why don't these functions take evar-map if they work with EConstr?
  - Termops.pop
  - Termops.print_constr
    (it doesn't take neither the local environment, nor the the evar-map
     even if it works with EConstr)

- EConstr
  - check whether the location of:
    - types
    - modules
    - functions
    defined in this module makes sense.
  - check the relationship of functions defined in this module with the corresponding functions in the Term module
    - Are they just aliases?
    - If they are not aliases, are the corresponding functions in the Term module still being used by plugins?
    - ...
  - ...
