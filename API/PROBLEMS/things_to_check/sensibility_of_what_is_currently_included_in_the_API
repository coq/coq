INSTANCES:

- API.Evd.empty

  Does it make sense to expose "Evd.empty" ?
  Shouldn't plugin writers use "Evd.from_env" instead?

- API.Evd.existential_value

  Does it make sense to expose "Evd.existential_value" ?
  Can't plugin writers use "Evd.find" and "Evd.existential_opt_value"
  to achieve the same goal?

- API.Ftactic.bind

  Do we need both, "bind" as well as ">>=" ?

- API.Names.inductive

  Does it really make sense to define this type without universes?
  (when in kernel/term.mli when we define the "Ind" variant of the term,
   we use "puniverses" constructor).

  Shouldn't we update the definition of Names.inductive so that it directly includes universes
  (and so that we do not have to do that in Term module)?

- API.Proofview.tclTHEN
  API.Tacticals.tclTHEN
  API.Refiner.tclTHEN

  It makes sense to explain why do we need several variants of "tclTHEN" (as well as other) tacticals

- ...
