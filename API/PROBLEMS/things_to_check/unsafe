API contains a lot of elements that are marked (in some way) as "unsafe".

It would make sense to check
- why our plugins need these functions
  (and perhaps drop this dependency, in case there are "safe" ways how to achieve the same goals)
- drop them from the API
  (thereby not providing mechanisms to plugin writers that
   - are not strictly necessary
   - would enable them to make more mistakes)
- it is necessary to understand what exactly is "unsafe" about these functions
  (What property can they break? ...)
