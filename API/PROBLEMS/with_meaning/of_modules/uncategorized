Modules with questionable meaning:

================================================================================

INSTANCES

- Constr
  (This is a workaround for a dependency problem. Is there a way to get rid of it?)

- Hints
  (Why is this provided by Coq? Why not by Ltac-plugin?)

- Hooks
  (Why do we need mechanisms provided by this module?)

- Pfedit
  (What kind of operations is this module (and this module only) supposed to group?)

- Tactics
  (Don't these things belong to the "ltac_plugin"?)

- Tactics.New
  (If we have Tactics.New module, does that mean that things we have directly in
   the Tactics module can be considered as deprecated?)

- Tacticals
  (Don't these things belong to the "ltac_plugin"?)
