In order to enable "associative search" for elements within the module
(i.e. guess its location/name if we know the properties of an element)
it would make sense to define some convention(s) concerning the order
in which we list individual elements (functions) in the module.

HINT:

  Context.Rel.Declaration

    - the actual data-type
    - getters
    - setters
    - predicates
      (ordered from the most simple ones to the most complicated ones)
      - is_*
      - exists
      - for_all
      - equal
    - mapping function(s)
    - folding function(s)
    - convertors
      (from the current type to another types)
