If the order of parameters of a function is not random, but follows some conventions,
then it is easier to remember it. That's helpful when we want to call that function.

If there is a possibility to find some practical conventions,
then we should:
- define them
- follow them in the actual code.

One of the good candidates for such conventions could be: "subject goes first".

E.g. if we have a module "M" that defines an (abstract) data-type "M.t"
and provides various operations "M.o1", "M.o2", ... , "M.on" with values of type "M.t",
then instead of letting individual operations take parameters in random order,
we might want to follow a convention that the first parameter of individual operations
always has type "M.t".
