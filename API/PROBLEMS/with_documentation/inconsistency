There are cases when the documentation and the source code
- use different names for the same concept
- use the same name for different concepts

================================================================================

INSTANCES

- What we call "constant" in the source code is called "global declaration" in the reference manual.
  (although they are talking about the same concept at different abstraction level,
   there is no need to use two different names for the same concept.
   This might mislead the reader to thinking that there are talking about two unrelated concepts
   rather then essential one and the same thing.)

- What we call "environment" in the source code does not correspond to what we
  call "(global) enviornment" in the Reference manual. This is a mistake because
  even though we are talking about two related concepts, they are not the same concept.
  It is thus a mistake to use the same name for two different concepts.

- Both, Reference Manual as well as the camlp5 parser defines non-terminals.
  It is therefore reasonable to expect that the same non-terminal will have the same/analogous name
  in both places.
