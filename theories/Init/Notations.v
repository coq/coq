(** These are the notations whose level and associativity are imposed by Coq *)

(** Notations for propositional connectives *)

Reserved Notation "x -> y" (at level 99, right associativity, y at level 200).

Reserved Notation "x && y" (at level 40, left associativity).

(** Notations for pairs *)

Reserved Notation "( x , y , .. , z )" (at level 0).

(** Notation "{ x }" is reserved and has a special status as component
    of other notations such as "{ A } + { B }" and "A + { B }" (which
    are at the same level as "x + y");
    "{ x }" is at level 0 to factor with "{ x : A | P }" *)
