    is provided too.

(** * Equality *)

(** [eq x y], or simply [x=y] expresses the equality of [x] and

    The definition is inductive and states the reflexivity of the equality.
    The others properties (symmetry, transitivity, replacement of 
    equals by equals) are proved below. The type of [x] and [y] can be
    made explicit using the notation [x = y :> A]. This is Leibniz equality
    as it expresses that [x] and [y] are equal iff every property on
    [A] which is true of [x] is also true of [y] *)
