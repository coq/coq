(* The following tactic uses solve_predicate_wd to solve the goals
relating to well-defidedness that are produced by applying induction.
We declare it to take the tactic that applies the induction theorem
and not the induction theorem itself because the tactic may, for
example, supply additional arguments, as does NZinduct_center in
NZBase.v *)
