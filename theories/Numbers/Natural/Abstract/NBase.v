Module NBasePropFunct (Import NAxiomsMod : NAxiomsSig).

Open Local Scope NatScope.

(* We call the last property functor on NZ, which includes all the previous
ones, to get all properties of NZ at once. This way we will include them
only one time. *)

Module Export NZTimesOrderMod := NZTimesOrderPropFunct NZOrdAxiomsMod.

(* Here we probably need to re-prove all axioms declared in NAxioms.v to
make sure that the definitions like N, S and plus are unfolded in them,
since unfolding is done only inside a functor. In fact, we'll do it in the
files that prove the corresponding properties. In those files, we will also
rename properties proved in NZ files by removing NZ from their names. In
this way, one only has to consult, for example, NPlus.v to see all
available properties for plus, i.e., one does not have to go to NAxioms.v
for axioms and NZPlus.v for theorems. *)

commands again, since the data for stepl and stepr tactics is inherited
from NZ. *)
