(* In 8.7, omega wasn't taking advantage of local abbreviations,
   see bug 148 and PR#768. For adjusting this flag, we're forced to
   first dynlink the omega plugin, but we should avoid doing a full
   "Require Omega", since it has some undesired effects (at least on hints)
   and breaks at least fiat-crypto. *)
Declare ML Module "omega_plugin".
Unset Omega UseLocalDefs.
