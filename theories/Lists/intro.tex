\section{Lists}\label{Lists}

This library includes the following files:

\begin{itemize}

\item {\tt List.v} THIS OLD LIBRARY IS HERE ONLY FOR COMPATIBILITY
  WITH OLDER VERSIONS OF COQS. THE USER SHOULD USE POLYLIST INSTEAD.

\item {\tt PolyList.v} contains definitions of (polymorphic) lists, 
  functions on lists such as head, tail, map, append and prove some
  properties of these functions. Implicit arguments are used in this
  library, so you should read the Referance Manual about implicit
  arguments before using it.

\item {\tt TheoryList.v} contains complementary results on lists. Here
  a more theoric point of view is assumed : one extracts functions
  from propositions, rather than defining functions and then prove them.

\item {\tt Streams.v} defines the type of infinite lists (streams). It is a
  coinductive type. Basic facts are stated and proved. The streams are
  also polymorphic.

\end{itemize}
