\section{Lists}\label{Lists}

This library includes the following files:

\begin{itemize}

\item {\tt List.v} contains definitions of (polymorphic) lists, 
  functions on lists such as head, tail, map, append and prove some
  properties of these functions. Implicit arguments are used in this
  library, so you should read the Reference Manual about implicit
  arguments before using it.

\item {\tt ListSet.v} contains definitions and properties of finite
  sets, implemented as lists.

\item {\tt TheoryList.v} contains complementary results on lists. Here
  a more theoretic point of view is assumed : one extracts functions
  from propositions, rather than defining functions and then prove them.

\item {\tt Streams.v} defines the type of infinite lists (streams). It is a
  coinductive type. Basic facts are stated and proved. The streams are
  also polymorphic.

\item {\tt MonoList.v} THIS OLD LIBRARY IS HERE ONLY FOR COMPATIBILITY
  WITH OLDER VERSIONS OF COQ. THE USER SHOULD USE {\tt List.v} INSTEAD.

\end{itemize}
