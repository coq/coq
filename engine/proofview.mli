    type is the state which tactics manipulate (a global state for
    existential variables, together with the list of goals), and the type
    ['a tactic] is the (abstract) type of tactics modifying the proof
    state and returning a value of type ['a]. *)

(** Initialises a proofview, the main argument is a list of

    hypotheses) pair with conclusion types, creating accordingly many
    initial goals. Because a proof does not necessarily starts in an
    empty [evar_map] (indeed a proof can be triggered by an incomplete
    pretyping), [init] takes an additional argument to represent the
    initial [evar_map]. *)

(** {6 The tactic monad} *)

(** - Tactics are objects which apply a transformation to all the
    subgoals of the current view at the same time. By opposition to
    the old vision of applying it to a single goal. It allows tactics
    such as [shelve_unifiable], tactics to reorder the focused goals,
    or global automation tactic for dependent subgoals (instantiating
    an evar has influences on the other goals of the proof in
    progress, not being able to take that into account causes the
    current eauto tactic to fail on some instances where it could
    succeed).  Another benefit is that it is possible to write tactics
    that can be executed even if there are no focused goals.
    - Tactics form a monad ['a tactic], in a sense a tactic can be
    seen as a function (without argument) which returns a value of
    type 'a and modifies the environment (in our case: the view).
    Tactics of course have arguments, but these are given at the
    meta-level as OCaml functions.  Most tactics in the sense we are
    used to return [()], that is no really interesting values. But
    some might pass information around.  The tactics seen in Coq's
    Ltac are (for now at least) only [unit tactic], the return values
    are kept for the OCaml toolkit.  The operation or the monad are
    [Proofview.tclUNIT] (which is the "return" of the tactic monad)
    [Proofview.tclBIND] (which is the "bind") and [Proofview.tclTHEN]
    (which is a specialized bind on unit-returning tactics).
    - Tactics have support for full-backtracking. Tactics can be seen
    having multiple success: if after returning the first success a
    failure is encountered, the tactic can backtrack and use a second
    success if available. The state is backtracked to its previous
    value, except the non-logical state defined in the {!NonLogical}
    module below.

(** The abstract type of tactics *)
type +'a tactic 

(** Applies a tactic to the current proofview. Returns a tuple
    [a,pv,(b,sh,gu)] where [a] is the return value of the tactic, [pv]
    is the updated proofview, [b] a boolean which is [true] if the
    tactic has not done any action considered unsafe (such as
    admitting a lemma), [sh] is the list of goals which have been
    shelved by the tactic, and [gu] the list of goals on which the
    tactic has given up. In case of multiple success the first one is
    selected. If there is no success, fails with
    {!Logic_monad.TacticFailure}*)

(** {7 Failure and backtracking} *)

(** [tclZERO e] fails with exception [e]. It has no success. *)
val tclZERO : ?info:Exninfo.info -> exn -> 'a tactic

(** [tclOR t1 t2] behaves like [t1] as long as [t1] succeeds. Whenever
    the successes of [t1] have been depleted and it failed with [e],
    then it behaves as [t2 e]. In other words, [tclOR] inserts a
    backtracking point. *)
val tclOR : 'a tactic -> (iexn -> 'a tactic) -> 'a tactic

(** [tclORELSE t1 t2] is equal to [t1] if [t1] has at least one
    success or [t2 e] if [t1] fails with [e]. It is analogous to
    [try/with] handler of exception in that it is not a backtracking
    point. *)
val tclORELSE : 'a tactic -> (iexn -> 'a tactic) -> 'a tactic

(** [tclIFCATCH a s f] is a generalisation of {!tclORELSE}: if [a]
    succeeds at least once then it behaves as [tclBIND a s] otherwise,
    if [a] fails with [e], then it behaves as [f e]. *)
val tclIFCATCH : 'a tactic -> ('a -> 'b tactic) -> (iexn -> 'b tactic) -> 'b tactic

(** [tclONCE t] behave like [t] except it has at most one success:
    [tclONCE t] stops after the first success of [t]. If [t] fails
    with [e], [tclONCE t] also fails with [e]. *)
val tclONCE : 'a tactic -> 'a tactic

(** [tclEXACTLY_ONCE e t] succeeds as [t] if [t] has exactly one
    success. Otherwise it fails. The tactic [t] is run until its first
    success, then a failure with exception [e] is simulated. It [t]
    yields another success, then [tclEXACTLY_ONCE e t] fails with
    [MoreThanOneSuccess] (it is a user error). Otherwise,
    [tclEXACTLY_ONCE e t] succeeds with the first success of
    [t]. Notice that the choice of [e] is relevant, as the presence of
    further successes may depend on [e] (see {!tclOR}). *)
exception MoreThanOneSuccess
val tclEXACTLY_ONCE : exn -> 'a tactic -> 'a tactic

(** [tclCASE t] splits [t] into its first success and a
    continuation. It is the most general primitive to control
    backtracking. *)
type 'a case =
  | Fail of iexn
  | Next of 'a * (iexn -> 'a tactic)
val tclCASE : 'a tactic -> 'a case tactic

(** [tclBREAK p t] is a generalization of [tclONCE t]. Instead of
    stopping after the first success, it succeeds like [t] until a
    failure with an exception [e] such that [p e = Some e'] is raised. At
    which point it drops the remaining successes, failing with [e'].
    [tclONCE t] is equivalent to [tclBREAK (fun e -> Some e) t]. *)
val tclBREAK : (iexn -> iexn option) -> 'a tactic -> 'a tactic


(** {7 Focusing tactics} *)

(** [tclFOCUS i j t] applies [t] after focusing on the goals number
    [i] to [j] (see {!focus}). The rest of the goals is restored after
    the tactic action. If the specified range doesn't correspond to
    existing goals, fails with [NoSuchGoals] (a user error). this
    exception is caught at toplevel with a default message + a hook
    message that can be customized by [set_nosuchgoals_hook] below.
    This hook is used to add a suggestion about bullets when
    applicable. *)
exception NoSuchGoals of int
val set_nosuchgoals_hook: (int -> Pp.t) -> unit

val tclFOCUS : int -> int -> 'a tactic -> 'a tactic

(** [tclFOCUSLIST li t] applies [t] on the list of focused goals
    described by [li]. Each element of [li] is a pair [(i, j)] denoting
    the goals numbered from [i] to [j] (inclusive, starting from 1).
    It will try to apply [t] to all the valid goals in any of these
    intervals. If the set of such goals is not a single range, then it
    will move goals such that it is a single range. (So, for
    instance, [[1, 3-5]; idtac.] is not the identity.)
    If the set of such goals is empty, it will fail. *)
val tclFOCUSLIST : (int * int) list -> 'a tactic -> 'a tactic

(** [tclFOCUSID x t] applies [t] on a (single) focused goal like
    {!tclFOCUS}. The goal is found by its name rather than its
    number.*)
val tclFOCUSID : Names.Id.t -> 'a tactic -> 'a tactic

(** [tclTRYFOCUS i j t] behaves like {!tclFOCUS}, except that if the
    specified range doesn't correspond to existing goals, behaves like
    [tclUNIT ()] instead of failing. *)
val tclTRYFOCUS : int -> int -> unit tactic -> unit tactic


(** {7 Dispatching on goals} *)

(** Dispatch tacticals are used to apply a different tactic to each
    goal under focus. They come in two flavours: [tclDISPATCH] takes a
    list of [unit tactic]-s and build a [unit tactic]. [tclDISPATCHL]
    takes a list of ['a tactic] and returns an ['a list tactic].

    They both work by applying each of the tactic in a focus
    restricted to the corresponding goal (starting with the first
    goal). In the case of [tclDISPATCHL], the tactic returns a list of
    the same size as the argument list (of tactics), each element
    being the result of the tactic executed in the corresponding goal.

    When the length of the tactic list is not the number of goal,
    raises [SizeMismatch (g,t)] where [g] is the number of available
    goals, and [t] the number of tactics passed. *)
exception SizeMismatch of int*int
val tclDISPATCH : unit tactic list -> unit tactic
val tclDISPATCHL : 'a tactic list -> 'a list tactic

(** [tclEXTEND b r e] is a variant of {!tclDISPATCH}, where the [r]
    tactic is "repeated" enough time such that every goal has a tactic
    assigned to it ([b] is the list of tactics applied to the first
    goals, [e] to the last goals, and [r] is applied to every goal in
    between). *)
val tclEXTEND : unit tactic list -> unit tactic -> unit tactic list -> unit tactic

(** [tclINDEPENDENT tac] runs [tac] on each goal successively, from
    the first one to the last one. Backtracking in one goal is
    independent of backtracking in another. It is equivalent to
    [tclEXTEND [] tac []]. *)

(** [unifiable sigma g l] checks whether [g] appears in another

    and the returned list contains only unsolved goals. *)

(** [swap i j] swaps the position of goals number [i] and [j]
    (negative numbers can be used to address goals from the end. Goals
    are indexed from [1]. For simplicity index [0] corresponds to goal
    [1] as well, rather than raising an error. *)
