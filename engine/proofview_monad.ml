module Trace = struct

  (** To build a trace incrementally, we use an intermediary data
      structure on which we can define an S-expression like language
      (like a simplified xml except the closing tags do not carry a
      name). Note that nodes are built from right to left in ['a
      incr], the result is mirrored when returning so that in the
      exposed interface, the forest is read from left to right.

      Concretely, we want to add a new tree to a forest: and we are
      building it by adding new trees to the left of its left-most
      subtrees which is built the same way. *)
