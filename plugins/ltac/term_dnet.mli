(** Dnets on constr terms.

   An instantiation of Dnet on (an approximation of) constr. It
   associates a term (possibly with Evar) with an
   identifier. Identifiers must be unique (no two terms sharing the
   same ident), and there must be a way to recover the full term from
   the identifier (function constr_of).

   Optionally, a pre-treatment on terms can be performed before adding
   or searching (reduce). Practically, it is used to do some kind of
   delta-reduction on terms before indexing them.

   The results returned here are perfect, since post-filtering is done
   inside here.

   See tactics/dnet.mli for more details.
