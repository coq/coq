(** Extraction of [positive], [N] and [Z] into Ocaml's [big_int] *)

Require Import ZArith NArith.
Require Import ExtrOcamlBasic.

(** NB: The extracted code should be linked with [nums.cm(x)a]
    from ocaml's stdlib and with the wrapper [big.ml] that
    simlifies the use of [Big_int] (it could be found in the sources
    of Coq). *)

(** Disclaimer: trying to obtain efficient certified programs
    by extracting [Z] into [big_int] isn't necessarily a good idea.
    See the Disclaimer in [ExtrOcamlNatInt]. *)

(** Mapping of [positive], [Z], [N] into [big_int]. The last strings
    emulate the matching, see documentation of [Extract Inductive]. *)
