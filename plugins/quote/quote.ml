(* The `Quote' tactic *)

(* The basic idea is to automatize the inversion of interpetation functions
   in 2-level approach

   Examples are given in \texttt{theories/DEMOS/DemoQuote.v}

   Suppose you have a langage \texttt{L} of 'abstract terms'
   and a type \texttt{A} of 'concrete terms'
   and a function \texttt{f : L -> (varmap A L) -> A}.

   Then, the tactic \texttt{quote f} will replace an
   expression \texttt{e} of type \texttt{A} by \texttt{(f vm t)}
   such that \texttt{e} and \texttt{(f vm t)} are convertible.

   The problem is then inverting the function \texttt{f}.

   The tactic works when:

   \begin{itemize}
   \item L is a simple inductive datatype. The constructors of L may
     have one of the three following forms:

     \begin{enumerate}
     \item ordinary recursive constructors like: \verb|Cplus : L -> L -> L|
     \item variable leaf like: \verb|Cvar : index -> L|
     \item constant leaf like \verb|Cconst : A -> L|
     \end{enumerate}

     The definition of \texttt{L} must contain at most one variable
     leaf and at most one constant leaf.

     When there are both a variable leaf and a constant leaf, there is
     an ambiguity on inversion. The term t can be either the
     interpretation of \texttt{(Cconst t)} or the interpretation of
     (\texttt{Cvar}~$i$) in a variable map containing the binding $i
     \rightarrow$~\texttt{t}. How to discriminate between these
     choices?

     To solve the dilemma, one gives to \texttt{quote} a list of
     \emph{constant constructors}: a term will be considered as a
     constant if it is either a constant constructor or the
     application of a constant constructor to constants. For example
     the list \verb+[S, O]+ defines the closed natural
     numbers. \texttt{(S (S O))} is a constant when \texttt{(S x)} is
     not.

     The definition of constants vary for each application of the
     tactic, so it can even be different for two applications of
     \texttt{quote} with the same function.

   \item \texttt{f} is a quite simple fixpoint on
     \texttt{L}. In particular, \texttt{f} must verify:

\begin{verbatim}
     (f (Cvar i)) = (varmap_find vm default_value i)
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}
     (f (Cconst c)) = c
\end{verbatim}

     where \texttt{index} and \texttt{varmap\_find} are those defined
     the \texttt{Quote} module. \emph{The tactic won't work with
     user's own variables map!!}  It is mandatory to use the
     variable map defined in module \texttt{Quote}.

   \end{itemize}

   The method to proceed is then clear:

   \begin{itemize}
   \item Start with an empty hashtable of "registed leafs"
      that maps constr to integers and a "variable counter" equal to 0.
    \item Try to match the term with every right hand side of the
      definition of \texttt{f}.

      If there is one match, returns the correponding left hand
      side and call yourself recursively to get the arguments of this
      left hand side.

      If there is no match, we are at a leaf. That is the
      interpretation of either a variable or a constant.

      If it is a constant, return \texttt{Cconst} applied to that
      constant.

      If not, it is a variable. Look in the hashtable
      if this leaf has been already encountered. If not, increment
      the variable counter and add an entry to the hashtable; then
      return \texttt{(Cvar !variables\_counter)}
   \end{itemize}

(*s First, we need to access some Coq constants
  We do that lazily, because this code can be linked before
  the constants are loaded in the environment *)

let constant dir s = Coqlib.gen_constant "Quote" ("quote"::dir) s

let coq_Empty_vm = lazy (constant ["Quote"] "Empty_vm")
let coq_Node_vm = lazy (constant ["Quote"] "Node_vm")
let coq_varmap_find = lazy (constant ["Quote"] "varmap_find")
let coq_Right_idx = lazy (constant ["Quote"] "Right_idx")
let coq_Left_idx = lazy (constant ["Quote"] "Left_idx")
let coq_End_idx = lazy (constant ["Quote"] "End_idx")

(*s Then comes the stuff to decompose the body of interpetation function
  and pre-compute the inversion data.

For a function like:

\begin{verbatim}
  Fixpoint interp (vm:varmap Prop) (f:form) :=
     match f with
       | f_and f1 f1 f2 => (interp f1) /\ (interp f2)
       | f_or f1 f1 f2 => (interp f1) \/ (interp f2)
       | f_var i => varmap_find Prop default_v i vm
       | f_const c => c
     end.
\end{verbatim}

With the constant constructors \texttt{C1}, \dots, \texttt{Cn}, the
corresponding scheme will be:

\begin{verbatim}
  {normal_lhs_rhs =
     [ "(f_and ?1 ?2)", "?1 /\ ?2";
       "(f_or ?1 ?2)", " ?1 \/ ?2";];
   return_type = "Prop";
   constants = Some [C1,...Cn];
   variable_lhs = Some "(f_var ?1)";
   constant_lhs = Some "(f_const ?1)"
  }
\end{verbatim}

If there is no constructor for variables in the type \texttt{form},
then [variable_lhs] is [None]. Idem for constants and
[constant_lhs]. Both cannot be equal to [None].

The metas in the RHS must correspond to those in the LHS (one cannot
exchange ?1 and ?2 in the example above)
