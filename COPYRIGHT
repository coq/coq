This version contains modifications by Lionel Elie Mamane
<lionel@mamane.lu> done while under employment of the Radboud
University Nijmegen. However, no copyright-assignment-to-employer
agreement was signed, and copyright of articles and books written on
work time rest with the employee. By analogy, it is Lionel's opinion
that copyright on these changes rests with him.
