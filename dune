; Information about flags for release mode:
;
; In #9665 we tried to add (c_flags -O3) to the release setup,
; unfortunately the resulting VM seems to be slower [5% slower on
; fourcolor, thus we keep the default C flags for now, which seem to
; be -O2.

; The _ profile could help factoring the above, however it doesn't
; seem to work like we'd expect/like:
