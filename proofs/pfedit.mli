(** [start_proof s str env t hook tac] starts a proof of name [s] and
    conclusion [t]; [hook] is optionally a function to be applied at
    proof end (e.g. to declare the built constructions as a coercion
    or a setoid morphism); init_tac is possibly a tactic to
    systematically apply at initialization time (e.g. to start the
    proof of mutually dependent theorems) *)

(** [cook_proof opacity] turns the current proof (assumed completed) into
    a constant with its name, kind and possible hook (see [start_proof]);
    it fails if there is no current proof of if it is not completed;
    it also tells if the guardness condition has to be inferred. *)

(** A variant of the above function that handles open terms as well.
    Caveat: all effects are purged in the returned term at the end, but other
    evars solved by side-effects are NOT purged, so that unexpected failures may
    occur. Ideally all code using this function should be rewritten in the
    monad. *)
