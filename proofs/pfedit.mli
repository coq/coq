(** Several proofs can be opened simultaneously but at most one is
   focused at some time. The following functions work by side-effect
   on current set of open proofs. In this module, ``proofs'' means an
   open proof (something started by vernacular command [Goal], [Lemma]
   or [Theorem]), and ``goal'' means a subgoal of the current focused
   proof *)

(** {6 ... } *)
(** [refining ()] tells if there is some proof in progress, even if a not
   focused one *)

val refining : unit -> bool

(** [check_no_pending_proofs ()] fails if there is still some proof in
   progress *)

val check_no_pending_proofs : unit -> unit

(** {6 ... } *)
(** [delete_proof name] deletes proof of name [name] or fails if no proof
    has this name *)

(** [delete_current_proof ()] deletes current focused proof or fails if
    no proof is focused *)

val delete_current_proof : unit -> unit

(** [delete_all_proofs ()] deletes all open proofs if any *)

val delete_all_proofs : unit -> unit

(** {6 ... } *)
(** [start_proof s str env t hook tac] starts a proof of name [s] and
    conclusion [t]; [hook] is optionally a function to be applied at
    proof end (e.g. to declare the built constructions as a coercion
    or a setoid morphism); init_tac is possibly a tactic to
    systematically apply at initialization time (e.g. to start the
    proof of mutually dependent theorems) *)

(** {6 ... } *)
(** [cook_proof opacity] turns the current proof (assumed completed) into
    a constant with its name, kind and possible hook (see [start_proof]);
    it fails if there is no current proof of if it is not completed;
    it also tells if the guardness condition has to be inferred. *)

    proof or failed if no proof is focused *)

val get_current_proof_name : unit -> Id.t

(** [get_all_proof_names ()] returns the list of all pending proof names.
    The first name is the current proof, the other names may come in
    any order. *)

(** [solve (SelectNth n) tac] applies tactic [tac] to the [n]th
    subgoal of the current focused proof or raises a [UserError] if no
    proof is focused or if there is no [n]th subgoal. [solve SelectAll
    tac] applies [tac] to all subgoals. *)

(** [by tac] applies tactic [tac] to the 1st subgoal of the current
    focused proof or raises a UserError if there is no focused proof or
    if there is no more subgoals.
    Returns [false] if an unsafe tactic has been used. *)

val by : unit Proofview.tactic -> bool

(** [instantiate_nth_evar_com n c] instantiate the [n]th undefined
   existential variable of the current focused proof by [c] or raises a

   existential variable *)

(** [build_by_tactic typ tac] returns a term of type [typ] by calling
