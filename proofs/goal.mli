(* This module implements the abstract interface to goals *)

type goal

(* spiwack: this primitive is not extremely brilliant. It may be a good
    idea to define goals and proof views in the same file to avoid this
    sort of communication pipes. But I find it heavy. *)
val build : Evd.evar -> goal 

(* [advance sigma g] returns [Some g'] if [g'] is undefined and 
    is the current avatar of [g] (for instance [g] was changed by [clear]
    into [g']). It returns [None] if [g] has been (partially) solved. *)

val advance : Evd.evar_map -> goal -> goal option


(*** Goal tactics ***)


(* Goal tactics are [subgoal sensitive]-s *)
type subgoals = private { subgoals: goal list }

(* Goal sensitive values *)
type +'a sensitive

(* evaluates a goal sensitive value in a given goal (knowing the current evar_map). *)
val eval : 'a sensitive -> Environ.env -> Evd.evar_map -> goal -> 'a * Evd.evar_map

(* monadic bind on sensitive expressions *)
val bind : 'a sensitive -> ('a -> 'b sensitive) -> 'b sensitive

(* monadic return on sensitive expressions *)
val return : 'a -> 'a sensitive


(* interpretation of "open" constr *)
(* spiwack: it is a wrapper around [Constrintern.interp_open_constr]. 
    In an ideal world, this could/should be the other way round.
    As of now, though, it seems at least quite useful to build tactics. *)
val interp_constr : Topconstr.constr_expr -> Term.constr sensitive

(* Type of constr with holes used by refine. *)
type refinable

module Refinable : sig
  type t = refinable 
  type handle

  val make : (handle -> Term.constr sensitive) -> refinable sensitive
  val make_with : (handle -> (Term.constr*'a) sensitive) -> (refinable*'a) sensitive

  val mkEvar : handle -> Environ.env -> Term.types -> Term.constr sensitive

  (* [with_type c typ] constrains term [c] to have type [typ].  *)
  val with_type : Term.constr -> Term.types -> Term.constr sensitive

  val resolve_typeclasses : ?onlyargs:bool -> ?split:bool -> ?fail:bool -> unit -> unit sensitive


  (* [constr_of_raw h check_type resolve_classes] is a pretyping function.
      The [check_type] argument asks whether the term should have the same
      type as the conclusion. [resolve_classes] is a flag on pretyping functions
      which, if set to true, calls the typeclass resolver.
      The principal argument is a [rawconstr] which is then pretyped in the
      context of a term, the remaining evars are registered to the handle.
      It is the main component of the toplevel refine tactic.*)
  val constr_of_raw : 
    handle -> bool -> bool -> Rawterm.rawconstr -> Term.constr sensitive

end

(* [refine t] takes a refinable term and use it as a partial proof for current
    goal. *)
val refine : refinable -> subgoals sensitive


(*** Cleaning  goals ***)

(* Implements the [clear] tactic *)
val clear : Names.identifier list -> subgoals sensitive

(* Implements the [clearbody] tactic *)
val clear_body : Names.identifier list -> subgoals sensitive


(*** Conversion in goals ***)

(* Changes an hypothesis of the goal with a convertible type and body.
   Checks convertibility if the boolean argument is true. *)
val convert_hyp : bool -> Term.named_declaration -> subgoals sensitive

(* Changes the conclusion of the goal with a convertible type and body.
   Checks convertibility if the boolean argument is true. *)
val convert_concl : bool -> Term.constr -> subgoals sensitive

(*** Bureaucracy in hypotheses ***)

(* Renames a hypothesis. *)
val rename_hyp : Names.identifier -> Names.identifier -> subgoals sensitive

(*** Sensitive primitives ***)

(* [concl] is the conclusion of the current goal *)
val concl : Term.constr sensitive

(* [hyps] is the [named_context_val] representing the hypotheses
   of the current goal *)
val hyps : Environ.named_context_val sensitive

(* [env] is the current [Environ.env] containing both the 
   environment in which the proof is ran, and the goal hypotheses *)
val env : Environ.env sensitive

(* [defs] is the [Evd.evar_map] at the current evaluation point *)
val defs : Evd.evar_map sensitive

(* These four functions serve as foundation for the goal sensitive part
    of the tactic monad (see Proofview).
    [here] is a special sort of [return]: [here g a] is the value [a], but
    does not have any value (it raises an exception) if evaluated in
    any other goal than [g].
    [here_list] is the same, except with a list of goals rather than a single one.
    [plus a b] is the same as [a] if [a] is defined in the current goal, otherwise
    it is [b]. Effectively it's defined in the goals where [a] and [b] are defined.
    [null] is defined in no goal. (it is a neutral element for [plus]). *)
(* spiwack: these primitives are a bit hackish, but I couldn't find another way
    to pass information between goals, like for an intro tactic which gives to
    each goal the name of the variable it introduce.
    In pratice, in my experience, the primitives given in Proofview (in terms of
    [here] and [plus]) are sufficient to define any tactics, hence these might
    be another example of communication primitives between Goal and Proofview.
    Still, I can't see a way to prevent using the Proofview primitive to read
    a goal sensitive value out of its valid context. *)

(*** Additional functions ***)

(* emulates List.map for functions of type 
   [Evd.evar_map -> 'a -> 'b * Evd.evar_map] on lists of type 'a, by propagating
   new evar_map to next definition *)
val list_map : (Evd.evar_map -> 'a -> 'b * Evd.evar_map) ->

                        'b list *Evd.evar_map

(* Layer to implement v8.2 tactic engine ontop of the new architecture. 
   Types are different from what they used to be due to a change of the
   internal types. *)
