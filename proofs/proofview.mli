(* The proofview datastructure is a pure datastructure underlying the notion
   of proof (namely, a proof is a proofview which can evolve and has safety
   mechanisms attached).
   The general idea of the structure is that it is composed of a chemical
   solution: an unstructured bag of stuff which has some relations with
   one another, which represents the various subnodes of the proof. Together
   with a comb: a datastructure that gives some order to some of these nodes,
   namely the (focused) open goals.
   The natural candidate for the solution is an {!Evd.evar_map}, that is
   a calculus of evars. The comb is then a list of goals (evars wrapped
   with some extra information, like possible name anotations).
   There is also need of a list of the evars which initialised the proofview
   to be able to return information about the proofview. *)

val dependent_init  : telescope -> entry * proofview

(* Returns whether this proofview is finished or not. That is,

   refined functions to ide-s. This would be better than spawning a

val focus_context : focus_context -> Goal.goal list * Goal.goal list

(* [focus i j] focuses a proofview on the goals from index [i] to index [j] 
   (inclusive). (i.e. goals number [i] to [j] become the only goals of the
   returned proofview).
   It returns the focus proof, and a context for the focus trace. *)

(* The tactic monad:
   - Tactics are objects which apply a transformation to all
     the subgoals of the current view at the same time. By opposition
     to the old vision of applying it to a single goal. It allows 
     tactics such as [shelve_unifiable] or tactics to reorder
     the focused goals (not done yet).
     (* spiwack: the ordering of goals, though, is actually rather
        brittle. It would be much more interesting to find a more
        robust way to adress goals, I have no idea at this time 
        though*) 
     or global automation tactic for dependent subgoals (instantiating
     an evar has influences on the other goals of the proof in progress,
     not being able to take that into account causes the current eauto
     tactic to fail on some instances where it could succeed).
     Another benefit is that it is possible to write tactics that can
     be executed even if there are no focused goals.
   - Tactics form a monad ['a tactic], in a sense a tactic can be 
     seens as a function (without argument) which returns a value
     of type 'a and modifies the environement (in our case: the view).
     Tactics of course have arguments, but these are given at the 
     meta-level as OCaml functions.
     Most tactics in the sense we are used to return [()], that is
     no really interesting values. But some might pass information 
     around.
     (* spiwack: as far as I'm aware this doesn't really relate to
        F. Kirchner and C. MuÃ±oz.
     *)
     The tactics seen in Coq's Ltac are (for now at least) only 
     [unit tactic], the return values are kept for the OCaml toolkit.
     The operation or the monad are [Proofview.tclUNIT] (which is the 
     "return" of the tactic monad) [Proofview.tclBIND] (which is
     the "bind") and [Proofview.tclTHEN] (which is a specialized
     bind on unit-returning tactics).
