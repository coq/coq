(** The primitive refine tactic used to fill the holes in partial proofs. This
    is the recommanded way to write tactics when the proof term is easy to
    write down. Note that this is not the user-level refine tactic defined
    in Ltac which is actually based on the one below. *)

(** In [refine ?unsafe t], [t] is a term with holes under some
    [evar_map] context. The term [t] is used as a partial solution
    for the current goal (refine is a goal-dependent tactic), the
    new holes created by [t] become the new subgoals. Exceptions
    raised during the interpretation of [t] are caught and result in
    tactic failures. If [unsafe] is [false] (default is [true]) [t] is
    type-checked beforehand. *)
