(* Module defining the last essential tiles of interactive proofs.
   A proof deals with the focusing commands (including the braces and bullets),
   the shelf (see the [shelve] tactic) and given up goal (see the [give_up]
   tactic). A proof is made of the following:
   - Proofview: a proof is primarily the data of the current view.
     That which is shown to the user (as a remainder, a proofview
     is mainly the logical state of the proof, together with the
     currently focused goals).
   - Focus: a proof has a focus stack: the top of the stack contains
     the context in which to unfocus the current view to a view focused
     with the rest of the stack.
     In addition, this contains, for each of the focus context,  a 
     "focus kind" and a "focus condition" (in practice, and for modularity,
     the focus kind is actually stored inside the condition). To unfocus, one
     needs to know the focus kind, and the condition (for instance "no condition" or
     the proof under focused must be complete) must be met.
   - Shelf: A list of goals which have been put aside during the proof. They can be
     retrieved with the [Unshelve] command, or solved by side effects
   - Given up goals: as long as there is a given up goal, the proof is not completed.
     Given up goals cannot be retrieved, the user must go back where the tactic
     [give_up] was run and solve the goal there.
*)

(* Returns a stylised view of a proof for use by, for instance,
   ide-s. *)
(* spiwack: the type of [proof] will change as we push more refined
   functions to ide-s. This would be better than spawning a new nearly
   identical function everytime. Hence the generic name. *)
(* In this version: returns the focused goals, a representation of the
   focus stack (the goals at each level), a representation of the
   shelf (the list of goals on the shelf), a representation of the
   given up goals (the list of the given up goals) and the underlying
   evar_map *)

(*** Focusing actions ***)

(* ['a focus_kind] is the type used by focusing and unfocusing
    commands to synchronise. Focusing and unfocusing commands use
    a particular ['a focus_kind], and if they don't match, the unfocusing command
    will fail.
    When focusing with an ['a focus_kind], an information of type ['a] is
    stored at the focusing point. An example use is the "induction" tactic
    of the declarative mode where sub-tactics must be aware of the current
    induction argument. *)
type 'a focus_kind
val new_focus_kind : unit -> 'a focus_kind

(* To be authorized to unfocus one must meet the condition prescribed by
    the action which focused.
    Conditions always carry a focus kind, and inherit their type parameter
    from it.*)
type 'a focus_condition 
(* [no_cond] only checks that the unfocusing command uses the right
    [focus_kind].
   If [loose_end] (default [false]) is [true], then if the [focus_kind]
   doesn't match, then unfocusing can occur, provided it unfocuses
   an earlier focus.
   For instance bullets can be unfocused in the following situation
   [{- solve_goal. }] because they use a loose-end condition. *)
val no_cond : ?loose_end:bool -> 'a focus_kind -> 'a focus_condition
(* [done_cond] checks that the unfocusing command uses the right [focus_kind]
    and that the focused proofview is complete.
   If [loose_end] (default [false]) is [true], then if the [focus_kind]
   doesn't match, then unfocusing can occur, provided it unfocuses
   an earlier focus.
   For instance bullets can be unfocused in the following situation
   [{ - solve_goal. }] because they use a loose-end condition.  *)
