(** This module defines the structure of proof tree and the tactic type. So, it
   is used by [Proof_tree] and [Refiner] *)

type prim_rule =
  | Cut of bool * bool * Id.t * types
  | Refine of constr

(** Nowadays, the only rules we'll consider are the primitive rules *)

type rule = prim_rule

type goal = Goal.goal
