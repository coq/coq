(* The subproof datastructure is a pure datastructure underlying the notion
   of proof (namely, a proof is a subproof which can evolve and has safety
   mechanisms attached).
   The general idea of the structure is that it is composed of a chemical
   solution: an unstructured bag of stuff which has some relations with 
   one another, which represents the various subnodes of the proof, together
   with a comb: a datastructure that gives order to some of these nodes, 
   namely the open goals. 
   The natural candidate for the solution is an {!Evd.evar_defs}, that is
   a calculus of evars. The comb is then a list of goals (evars wrapped 
   with some extra information, like possible name anotations).
   There is also need of a list of the evars which initialised the subproof
   to be able to return information about the subproof. *)

type subproof = {
     initial : Evd.evar list;
     solution : Evd.evar_defs;
     comb : Goal.goal list
     }

(* Function which returns the current state of refinement of the required
   evars. *)
let return { initial=init; solution=defs } =
  List.map Evarutil.nf_evar (List.map Term ??)
