(* File to include to install the pretty-printers in the ocaml toplevel *)

(* Typical usage :

   $ dune exec -- dev/shim/coqbyte-prelude
   Coq < Drop.
   # #use "include";;

   Alternatively, you can avoid typing #use "include" after each Drop
   by adding the following lines in your $HOME/.ocamlinit :

   #directory "+compiler-libs";;
   if Filename.basename Sys.argv.(0) = "coqtop.byte"
   then ignore (Toploop.use_silently Format.std_formatter "dev/include")
*)

#use "incdir_dune";;
#use "base_include";;
#use "inc_ltac_dune";;
#use "include_printers";;
