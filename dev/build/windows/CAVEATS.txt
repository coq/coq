===== Environemt SIZE =====

find and xargs can fail if the environment is to large. I think the limit is 8k.

xargs --show-limits

shows the actual environment size

The configure_profile.sh script sets ORIGINAL_PATH (set by cygwin) to "" to
avoid issues

===== OCAMLLIB =====

If the environment variable OCAMLLIB is defined, it takes precedence over the
internal paths of ocaml tools. This usually messes up things considerably. A
typical failure is

Error: Error on dynamically loaded library: .\dlllablgtk2.dll: %1 is not a valid Win32 application.

The configure_profile.sh script clears OCAMLLIB, but if you use the ocaml
compiler from outside the provided cygwin shell, OCAMLLIB might be defined.
