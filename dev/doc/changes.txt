= CHANGES BETWEEN COQ V8.4 AND CQQ V8.5 =
=========================================

** Refactoring : more mli interfaces and simpler grammar.cma **

- A new directory intf/ now contains mli-only interfaces :

 Constrexpr : definition of constr_expr, was in Topconstr
 Decl_kinds : now contains binding_kind = Explicit | Implicit
 Evar_kinds : type Evar_kinds.t was previously Evd.hole_kind
 Extend : was parsing/extend.mli
 Genredexpr : regroup Glob_term.red_expr_gen and Tacexpr.glob_red_flag
 Glob_term  : definition of glob_constr
 Locus : definition of occurrences and stuff about clauses
 Misctypes : intro_pattern_expr, glob_sort, cast_type, or_var, ...
 Notation_term : contains notation_constr, was Topconstr.aconstr
 Pattern : contains constr_pattern
 Tacexpr : was tactics/tacexpr.ml
 Vernacexpr : was toplevel/vernacexpr.ml

- Many files have been divided :

 vernacexpr: vernacexpr.mli + Locality
 decl_kinds: decl_kinds.mli + Kindops
 evd: evar_kinds.mli + evd
 tacexpr: tacexpr.mli + tacops
 glob_term: glob_term.mli + glob_ops + genredexpr.mli + redops
 topconstr: constrexpr.mli + constrexpr_ops
            + notation_expr.mli + notation_ops + topconstr
 pattern: pattern.mli + patternops
 libnames: libnames (qualid, reference) + globnames (global_reference)
 egrammar: egramml + egramcoq

- New utility files : miscops (cf. misctypes.mli) and
  redops (cf genredexpr.mli).

- Some other directory changes :
  * grammar.cma and the source files specific to it are now in grammar/
  * pretty-printing files are now in printing/

- Inner-file changes :

  * aconstr is now notation_constr, all constructors for this type
    now start with a N instead of a A (e.g. NApp instead of AApp),
    and functions about aconstr may have been renamed (e.g. match_aconstr
    is now match_notation_constr).

  * occurrences (now in Locus.mli) is now an algebraic type, with
    - AllOccurrences instead of all_occurrences_expr = (false,[])
    - (AllOccurrencesBut l) instead of (all_occurrences_expr_but l) = (false,l)
    - NoOccurrences instead of no_occurrences_expr = (true,[])
    - (OnlyOccurrences l) instead of (no_occurrences_expr_but l) = (true,l)

  * move_location (now in Misctypes) has two new constructors
    MoveFirst and MoveLast replacing (MoveToEnd false) and (MoveToEnd true)

- API of pretyping.ml and constrintern.ml has been made more uniform
  * Parametrization of understand_* functions is now made using
    "inference flags"
  * Functions removed:
    - interp_constr_judgment (inline its former body if really needed)
    - interp_casted_constr, interp_type: use instead interp_constr with
      expected_type set to OfType or to IsType
    - interp_gen: use any of interp_constr, interp_casted_constr, interp_type
    - interp_open_constr_patvar
    - interp_context: use interp_context_evars (with a "evar_map ref") and
      call solve_remaining_evars afterwards with a failing flag
      (e.g. all_and_fail_flags)
    - understand_type, understand_gen: use understand with appropriate
      parameters
  * Change of semantics:
    - Functions interp_*_evars_impls have a different interface and do
      not any longer check resolution of evars by default; use
      check_evars_are_solved explicitly to check that evars are solved.
  See also the corresponding commit log.

- Tactics API: new_induct -> induction; new_destruct -> destruct;
  letin_pat_tac do not accept a type anymore

- New file find_subterm.ml for gathering former functions
  subst_closed_term_occ_modulo, subst_closed_term_occ_decl (which now
  take and outputs also an evar_map), and
  subst_closed_term_occ_modulo, subst_closed_term_occ_decl_modulo (now
  renamed into replace_term_occ_modulo and
  replace_term_occ_decl_modulo).

- API of Inductiveops made more uniform (see commit log or file itself).

- API of intros_pattern style tactic changed; "s" is dropped in
  "intros_pattern" and "intros_patterns" is not anymore behaving like
  tactic "intros" on the empty list.

- API of cut tactics changed: for instance, cut_intro should be replaced by
  "assert_after Anonymous"

- All functions taking an env and a sigma (or an evdref) now takes the
  env first.

=========================================
= CHANGES BETWEEN COQ V8.3 AND COQ V8.4 =
=========================================

** Functions in unification.ml have now the evar_map coming just after the env

** Removal of Tacinterp.constr_of_id **

Use instead either global_reference or construct_reference in constrintern.ml.

** Optimizing calls to Evd functions **

Evars are split into defined evars and undefined evars; for
efficiency, when an evar is known to be undefined, it is preferable to
use specific functions about undefined evars since these ones are
generally fewer than the defined ones.

** Type changes in TACTIC EXTEND rules **

Arguments bound with tactic(_) in TACTIC EXTEND rules are now of type
glob_tactic_expr, instead of glob_tactic_expr * tactic. Only the first
component is kept, the second one can be obtained via
Tacinterp.eval_tactic.

** ARGUMENT EXTEND **

It is now forbidden to use TYPED simultaneously with {RAW,GLOB}_TYPED
in ARGUMENT EXTEND statements.

** Renaming of rawconstr to glob_constr **

The "rawconstr" type has been renamed to "glob_constr" for
consistency. The "raw" in everything related to former rawconstr has
been changed to "glob". For more details about the rationale and
scripts to migrate code using Coq's internals, see commits 13743,
13744, 13755, 13756, 13757, 13758, 13761 (by glondu, end of December
2010) in Subversion repository. Contribs have been fixed too, and
commit messages there might also be helpful for migrating.

=========================================
= CHANGES BETWEEN COQ V8.2 AND COQ V8.3 =
=========================================

** Light cleaning in evarutil.ml **

whd_castappevar is now whd_head_evar
obsolete whd_ise disappears

** Restructuration of the syntax of binders **

binders_let -> binders
binders_let_fixannot -> binders_fixannot
binder_let -> closed_binder (and now covers only bracketed binders)
binder was already obsolete and has been removed

** Semantical change of h_induction_destruct **

Warning, the order of the isrec and evar_flag was inconsistent and has
been permuted. Tactic induction_destruct in tactics.ml is unchanged.

** Internal tactics renamed

There is no more difference between bindings and ebindings. The
following tactics are therefore renamed

apply_with_ebindings_gen -> apply_with_bindings_gen
left_with_ebindings -> left_with_bindings
right_with_ebindings -> right_with_bindings
split_with_ebindings -> split_with_bindings

apply_with_ebindings (use instead apply_with_bindings)
eapply_with_ebindings (use instead eapply_with_bindings)

** Obsolete functions in typing.ml

==============================================
= MAIN CHANGES BETWEEN COQ V7.3 AND COQ V7.4 =
==============================================

CHANGES DUE TO INTRODUCTION OF MODULES
======================================

1.Kernel
--------

  The module level has no effect on constr except for the structure of
section_path. The type of unique names for constructions (what
section_path served) is now called a kernel name and is defined by
 
type uniq_ident = int * string * dir_path (* int may be enough *)
type module_path =
  | MPfile of dir_path    (* reference to physical module, e.g. file *)
  | MPbound of uniq_ident (* reference to a module parameter in a functor *)
  | MPself of uniq_ident  (* reference to one of the containing module *)
  | MPdot of module_path * label
type label = identifier
type kernel_name = module_path * dir_path * label
                   ^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^
                        |           |         \
                        |           |          the base name
                        |           \
                       /             the (true) section path
   example:                          (non empty only inside open sections)
   L = (* i.e. some file of logical name L *)
   struct
     module A = struct Def a = ... end
   end
   M = (* i.e. some file of logical name M *)
   struct
     Def t = ...
     N = functor (X : sig module T = struct Def b = ... end end) -> struct
       module O = struct
         Def u = ...
       end
       Def x := ... <M>.t ... <N>.O.u ... X.T.b ... L.A.a
 
   <M> and <N> are self-references, X is a bound reference and L is a
reference to a physical module.
 
  Notice that functor application is not part of a path: it must be
named by a "module M = F(A)" declaration to be used in a kernel
name.
 
  Notice that Jacek chose a practical approach, making directories not
modules. Another approach could have been to replace the constructor
MPfile by a constant constructor MProot representing the root of the
world.
 
  Other relevant informations are in kernel/entries.ml (type
module_expr) and kernel/declarations.ml (type module_body and
module_type_body).                                                              

2. Library
----------

i) tables 
[Summaries] - the only change is the special treatment of the
global environmet.

ii) objects 
[Libobject] declares persistent objects, given with methods:

   * cache_function specifying how to add the object in the current
       scope;
   * load_function, specifying what to do when the module 
       containing the object is loaded; 
   * open_function, specifying what to do when the module 
       containing the object is opened (imported);
   * classify_function, specyfying what to do with the object,
       when the current module (containing the object) is ended. 
   * subst_function
   * export_function, to signal end_section survival

(Almost) Each of these methods is called with a parameter of type
object_name = section_path * kernel_name
where section_path is the full user name of the object (such as
Coq.Init.Datatypes.Fst) and kernel_name is its substitutive internal
version such as (MPself<Datatypes#1>,[],"Fst") (see above)


What happens at the end of an interactive module ?
==================================================
(or when a file is stored and reloaded from disk)

All summaries (except Global environment) are reverted to the state
from before the beginning of the module, and:

a) the objects (again, since last Declaremods.start_module or
   Library.start_library) are classified using the classify_function.
   To simplify consider only those who returned Substitute _ or Keep _.

b) If the module is not a functor, the subst_function for each object of
   the first group is called with the substitution 
   [MPself "<Datatypes#1>" |-> MPfile "Coq.Init.Datatypes"].
   Then the load_function is called for substituted objects and the
   "keep" object. 
   (If the module is a library the substitution is done at reloading).

c) The objects which returned substitute are stored in the modtab
   together with the self ident of the module, and functor argument
   names if the module was a functor.

   They will be used (substituted and loaded) when a command like 
     Module M := F(N)    or
     Module Z := N 
   is evaluated


The difference between "substitute" and "keep" objects
========================================================
i) The "keep" objects can _only_ reference other objects by section_paths
and qualids. They do not need the substitution function.

They will work after end_module (or reloading a compiled library),
because these operations do not change section_path's

They will obviously not work after Module Z:=N.
 
These would typically be grammar rules, pretty printing rules etc.



ii) The "substitute" objects can _only_ reference objects by
kernel_names. They must have a valid subst_function. 

They will work after end_module _and_ after Module Z:=N or 
Module Z:=F(M).



Other kinds of objects:
iii) "Dispose" - objects which do not survive end_module
     As a consequence, objects which reference other objects sometimes
     by kernel_names and sometimes by section_path must be of this kind...

iv) "Anticipate" - objects which must be treated individually by
    end_module (typically "REQUIRE" objects)



Writing subst_thing functions
=============================
The subst_thing shoud not copy the thing if it hasn't actually
changed. There are some cool emacs macros in dev/objects.el 
to help writing subst functions this way quickly and without errors.
Also there are *_smartmap functions in Util.

The subst_thing functions are already written for many types,
including constr (Term.subst_mps), 
global_reference (Libnames.subst_global),
rawconstr (Rawterm.subst_raw) etc

They are all (apart from constr, for now) written in the non-copying
way.


Nametab
=======

Nametab has been made more uniform. For every kind of thing there is
only one "push" function and one "locate" function. 


Lib
===

library_segment is now a list of object_name * library_item, where
object_name = section_path * kernel_name (see above)

New items have been added for open modules and module types


Declaremods
==========
Functions to declare interactive and noninteractive modules and module
types.


Library
=======
Uses Declaremods to actually communicate with Global and to register
objects.


OTHER CHANGES
=============

Internal representation of tactics bindings has changed (see type
Rawterm.substitution).

New parsing model for tactics and vernacular commands

  - Introduction of a dedicated type for tactic expressions
    (Tacexpr.raw_tactic_expr)
  - Introduction of a dedicated type for vernac expressions
    (Vernacexpr.vernac_expr)
  - Declaration of new vernacular parsing rules by a new camlp4 macro
    GRAMMAR COMMAND EXTEND ... END  to be used in ML files
  - Declaration of new tactics parsing/printing rules by a new camlp4 macro
    TACTIC EXTEND ... END  to be used in ML files

New organisation of THENS:
tclTHENS tac tacs : tacs is now an array
tclTHENSFIRSTn tac1 tacs tac2 :
  apply tac1 then, apply the array tacs on the first n subgoals and
  tac2 on the remaining subgoals (previously tclTHENST)
tclTHENSLASTn tac1 tac2 tacs :
  apply tac1 then, apply tac2 on the first subgoals and apply the array
  tacs on the last n subgoals
tclTHENFIRSTn tac1 tacs = tclTHENSFIRSTn tac1 tacs tclIDTAC (prev. tclTHENSI)
tclTHENLASTn tac1 tacs  = tclTHENSLASTn tac1 tclIDTAC tacs
tclTHENFIRST tac1 tac2  = tclTHENFIRSTn tac1 [|tac2|]
tclTHENLAST tac1 tac2   = tclTHENLASTn tac1 [|tac2|] (previously tclTHENL)
tclTHENS tac1 tacs = tclTHENSFIRSTn tac1 tacs (fun _ -> error "wrong number")
tclTHENSV same as tclTHENS but with an array
tclTHENSi : no longer available

Proof_type: subproof field in type proof_tree glued with the ref field

Tacmach: no more echo from functions of module Refiner

Files plugins/*/g_*.ml4 take the place of files plugins/*/*.v.
Files parsing/{vernac,tac}extend.ml{4,i} implements TACTIC EXTEND andd
  VERNAC COMMAND EXTEND macros
File syntax/PPTactic.v moved to parsing/pptactic.ml
Tactics about False and not now in tactics/contradiction.ml
Tactics depending on Init now tactics/*.ml4 (no longer in tactics/*.v)
File tacinterp.ml moved from proofs to directory tactics


==========================================
= MAIN CHANGES FROM COQ V7.1 TO COQ V7.2 =
==========================================

The core of Coq (kernel) has meen minimized with the following effects:

kernel/term.ml      split into kernel/term.ml,      pretyping/termops.ml
kernel/reduction.ml split into kernel/reduction.ml, pretyping/reductionops.ml
kernel/names.ml     split into kernel/names.ml,     library/nameops.ml
kernel/inductive.ml split into kernel/inductive.ml, pretyping/inductiveops.ml

the prefixes "Is" ans "IsMut" have been dropped from kind_of_term constructors,
e.g. IsRel is now Rel, IsMutCase is now Case, etc.

=======================================================

Changements d'organisation / modules :
--------------------------------------

  Std, More_util		-> lib/util.ml

  Names				-> kernel/names.ml et kernel/sign.ml
    (les parties noms et signatures ont été séparées)

  Avm,Mavm,Fmavm,Mhm  ->  utiliser plutôt Map (et freeze alors gratuit)

Changements dans les inductifs
------------------------------
Nouveaux types "constructor" et "inductive" dans Term
La plupart des fonctions de typage des inductives prennent maintenant
un inductive au lieu d'un oonstr comme argument. Les seules fonctions
à traduire un constr en inductive sont les find_rectype and co.

Changements dans les grammaires
-------------------------------

 . le lexer (parsing/lexer.mll) est maintenant un lexer ocamllex

 . attention : LIDENT -> IDENT  (les identificateurs n'ont pas de
                                 casse particulière dans Coq)

 . Le mot "command" est remplacé par "constr" dans les noms de
 fichiers, noms de modules et non-terminaux relatifs au parsing des
 termes; aussi les changements suivants "COMMAND"/"CONSTR" dans
 g_vernac.ml4, VARG_COMMAND/VARG_CONSTR dans vernac*.ml*

 . Les constructeurs d'arguments de tactiques IDENTIFIER, CONSTR, ...n
   passent en minuscule Identifier, Constr, ...
 
 . Plusieurs parsers ont changé de format (ex: sortarg)

Changements dans le pretty-printing
-----------------------------------

 . Découplage de la traduction de constr -> rawconstr (dans detyping)
    et de rawconstr -> ast (dans termast)
 . Déplacement des options d'affichage de printer vers termast
 . Déplacement des réaiguillage d'univers du pp de printer vers esyntax

	
Changements divers
------------------

 . il n'y a plus de script coqtop => coqtop et coqtop.byte sont
   directement le résultat du link du code
   => debuggage et profiling directs

 . il n'y a plus d'installation locale dans bin/$ARCH
 
 . #use "include.ml"  =>  #use "include"
   go()               =>  loop()

 . il y a "make depend" et "make dependcamlp4" car ce dernier prend beaucoup
   de temps
