- GH issue number: coq/coq#8341
- risk: unlikely to be activated by chance (requires a plugin)

#### template polymorphism not collecting side constraints on the universe level of a parameter

this is a general form of the previous issue about template
polymorphism exploiting other ways to generate untracked constraints

- component: template polymorphism
- introduced: morally at the introduction of template polymorphism, 23
- May 2006, [9c2d70b](https://github.com/coq/coq/commit/9c2d70b91341552e964979ba09d5823cc023a31c), r8845, Herbelin
- impacted released versions: at least V8.4-V8.4pl6, V8.5-V8.5pl3,
  V8.6-V8.6pl2, V8.7.0-V8.7.1, V8.8.0-V8.8.1, V8.9.0-V8.9.1, in theory
  also V8.1-V8.1pl4, V8.2-V8.2pl2, V8.3-V8.3pl2 but not exploit found
  there yet (an exploit using a plugin to force sharing of universe
  level is in principle possible though)
- impacted development branches: all from 8.4 to 8.9 at the time of writing and suspectingly also all from 8.1 to 8.4 if a way to create untracked constraints can be found
- impacted coqchk versions: a priori all (tested with V8.4 and V8.9 which accept the exploit)
- fixed in: V8.10.0 ([eb3f8225a2](https://github.com/coq/coq/commit/eb3f8225a286aef3a57ad876584b4a927241ff69), PR coq/coq#9918, Aug 2019, DÃ©nÃ¨s and Sozeau)
- found by: Gilbert using explicit sharing of universes, exploit found for 8.5-8.9 by PÃ©drot, other variants generating sharing using sections, or using ltac tricks by Sozeau, exploit in 8.4 by Herbelin and Jason Gross by adding new tricks to Sozeau's variants
- exploit: test-suite/failure/Template.v
- GH issue number: coq/coq#9294
- risk: moderate risk to be activated by chance

#### more template polymorphism missing constraints

using the same universe in the parameters and the constructor
arguments of a template polymorphic inductive (using named universes
in modern Coq, or unification tricks in older Coq) produces implicit
equality constraints not caught by the previous template polymorphism
fix.

- component: template polymorphism
- introduced: same as the previous template polymorphism bug, morally
  from V8.1, first verified impacted version V8.5 (the universe
  unification is sufficiently different in V8.4 to prevent our trick
  from working)
- fixed in: expected in 8.10.2, 8.11+beta, master (#11128, Nov 2019, Gilbert)
- found by: Gilbert
- exploit: test-suite/bugs/bug_11039.v
- GH issue number: coq/coq#11039
- risk: moderate risk (found by investigating coq/coq#10504)

#### universe constraints erroneously discarded when forcing an asynchronous proof containing delayed monomorphic constraints inside a universe polymorphic section

- component: universe polymorphism, asynchronous proofs
- introduced: between 8.4 and 8.5 by merging the asynchronous proofs feature branch and universe polymorphism one
- impacted released versions: V8.5-V8.10
- impacted development branches: none
- impacted coqchk versions: immune
- fixed in: coq/coq#10664
- found by: PÃ©drot
- exploit: no test
- GH issue number: none
- risk: unlikely to be triggered in interactive mode, not present in batch mode (i.e. coqc)

#### Set+2 incorrectly simplified to Set+1

- component: algebraic universes
- introduced: V8.10 (with the SProp commit [7550876976](https://github.com/coq/coq/commit/75508769762372043387c67a9abe94e8f940e80a))
- impacted released versions: V8.10.0 V8.10.1 V8.10.2
- impacted coqchk versions: same
- fixed in: coq/coq#11422
- found by: Gilbert
- exploit: see PR (custom application of Hurkens to get around the refreshing at elaboration)
- GH issue number: see PR
- risk: unlikely to be triggered through the vernacular (the system "refreshes" algebraic
    universes such that +2 increments do not appear), mild risk from plugins which manipulate
    algebraic universes.

#### variance inference for section universes ignored use of section universes in inductives and axioms defined before the inductive being inferred

- component: cumulative inductives and sections
- introduced: V8.12 ([73c3b87463](https://github.com/coq/coq/commit/73c3b874633d6f6f8af831d4a37d0c1ae52575bc))
- impacted released versions: V8.12 to V8.15 including patch releases

- fixed in: V8.16 coq/coq#15950 ([118ffbc010](https://github.com/coq/coq/commit/118ffbc010ce53ebd45baa42edd28335301ca9a5))
- found by: Gilbert and PÃ©drot
- exploit: see coq/coq#15916
- risk: could be used inadvertently in developments with complex universe usage, only when using cumulative inductives declared in sections. coqchk still works.

- introduced: [67c75fa01](https://github.com/coq/coq/commit/67c75fa01adbbe1d4e39eff2b930ad168510072c), 20 Jun 2002
- impacted released versions: 7.3.1, 7.4
- impacted coqchk versions:
- fixed by deciding to drop impredicativity of Set: [bac707973](https://github.com/coq/coq/commit/bac707973955ef64eadae24ea01e029a5394626e), 28 Oct 2004
- found by: Herbelin & Werner
- exploit: need to find the example again
- GH issue number: no
- risk: unlikely to be exploited by chance

#### guard condition was unknown to be inconsistent with propositional extensionality in library Sets

- component: library of extensional sets, guard condition
- introduced: not a bug per se but an incompatibility discovered late
- impacted released versions: technically speaking from V6.1 with the introduction of the Sets library which was then inconsistent from the very beginning without we knew it
- impacted coqchk versions: ?
- fixed by constraining the guard condition: ([9b272a8](https://github.com/coq/coq/commit/9b272a861bc3263c69b699cd2ac40ab2606543fa), [ccd7546c](https://github.com/coq/coq/commit/ccd7546cd32c8a7901a4234f86aa23b4a7e1a043) 28 Oct 2014, Barras, DÃ©nÃ¨s)
- found by: Schepler, DÃ©nÃ¨s, Azevedo de Amorim
- exploit: ?
- GH issue number: none
- risk: unlikely to be exploited by chance (?)

#### incompatibility axiom of choice and excluded-middle with elimination of large singletons to Set

- component: library for axiom of choice and excluded-middle
- introduced: not a bug but a change of intended "model"
- impacted released versions: strictly before 8.1
- impacted coqchk versions: ?
- fixed by constraining singleton elimination: [b19397ed8](https://github.com/coq/coq/commit/b19397ed88ef8aa1ea1ca228b5d23b94e15f419f), r9633, 9 Feb 2007, Herbelin

#### Incorrect specification of PrimFloat.leb

- component: primitive floating-points
- introduced: 8.11
- impacted released versions: 8.11.0, 8.11.1, 8.11.2
- fixed by fixing the spec: coq/coq#12484
- found by: Pierre Roux
- exploit: test-suite/bugs/bug_12483.v
- GH issue number: coq/coq#12483
- risk: proof of false when using the incorrect axiom

#### Incorrect implementation of SFclassify.

- component: floating-point library
- introduced: 8.11
- impacted released versions: 8.11.0-8.15.1
- fixed by fixing the implementation: coq/coq#16101
- found by: FranÃ§ois Bobot
- exploit: test-suite/bugs/bug_16096.v
- GH_issue_number: coq/coq#16096
- risk: proof of false when using the axioms in Floats.Axioms.

#### nativenorm reading back closures as arbitrary floating-point values

- component: primitive floating-points + "native" conversion machine (translation to OCaml which compiles to native code)
- introduced: 8.11
- impacted released versions: 8.11.0-8.17.1
- impacted coqchk versions: none (no native computation in coqchk)
- fixed in: 8.18.0
- found by: Jason Gross
- GH issue number: coq/coq#17871
- risk: proof of false when using primitive floats and native_compute

### Deserialization

#### deserialization of .vo data not properly checked

- component: coqchk (coqc trusts that .vo files are well formed)
- introduced: 8.16 (univ levels), 8.10 (retroknowledge)
- impacted released versions: 8.10-8.18.1
- impacted coqchk versions: same
- fixed in: 8.19
- found by: Mario Carneiro
- GH issue number: N/A (fix pull requests: coq/coq#18403, coq/coq#18406)
- risk: can lead to segfaults or arbitrary code execution on crafted .vo files
    (files produced by coqc are fine)

There were otherwise several bugs in beta-releases, from memory, bugs with beta versions of primitive projections or template polymorphism or native compilation or guard (e7fc96366, 2a4d714a1).

## Probably non exploitable fixed bugs

There were otherwise maybe unexploitable kernel bugs, e.g. 2df88d83
(Require overloading), 0adf0838 ("Univs: uncovered bug in
strengthening of opaque polymorphic definitions."), 5122a398 (#3746
about functors), coq/coq#4346 (casts in VM), a14bef4 (guard condition in
8.1), 6ed40a8 ("Georges' bug" with ill-typed lazy machine), and
various other bugs in 8.0 or 8.1 without knowing if they are critical.

#### bug in 31bit arithmetic

- component: "virtual machine" (compilation to bytecode ran by a C-interpreter)
- introduced: V8.1
- impacted released versions: none
- impacted development branches:
- impacted coqchk versions: none (no virtual machine in coqchk)
- fixed in: master/trunk/v8.5 (0f8d1b92c, 6 Sep 2015, DÃ©nÃ¨s)
- found by: DÃ©nÃ¨s, from a bug report by Tahina Ramananandro
- exploit: non exploitable?
- GH issue number: ?
