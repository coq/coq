Coq main source components (in link order)
------------------------------------------

clib : Basic files in lib/, such as util.ml
lib : Other files in lib/
kernel
library
pretyping
interp
proofs
printing
parsing
tactics
toplevel

highparsing :

 Files in parsing/ that cannot be linked too early.
 Contains the grammar rules g_*.ml4

hightactics :

 Files in tactics/ that cannot be linked too early.
 These are the .ml4 files that uses the EXTEND possibilities
 provided by grammar.cma, for instance eauto.ml4.


Special components
------------------

intf :

 Contains mli-only interfaces, many of them providing a.s.t.
 used for dialog bewteen coq components. Ex: Constrexpr.constr_expr
 produced by parsing and transformed by interp.

grammar :

 Camlp4 syntax extensions. The file grammar/grammar.cma is used
 to pre-process .ml4 files containing EXTEND constructions,
 either TACTIC EXTEND, ARGUMENTS EXTEND or VERNAC ... EXTEND.
 This grammar.cma incorporates many files from other directories
 (mainly parsing/), plus some specific files in grammar/.
 The other syntax extension grammar/q_constr.cmo is a addition to
 grammar.cma with a constr PATTERN quotation.

  V
constr_pattern_expr = constr_expr
  |
  | Constrintern.interp_constr_pattern (in interp)
  | reverse way in Constrextern
  V
Pattern.constr_pattern

  ---> used for instance by Matching.matches (in pretyping)


*** Notations ***


Notation_term.notation_constr

Conversion from/to glob_constr in Notation_ops

TODO...


*** Tactics ***

TODO: check with Hugo


*** Vernac expressions ***

Vernacexpr.vernac_expr, produced by parsing, used in Vernacentries and Vernac
