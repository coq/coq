How to debug universes?

1. There is a command Dump Universes in Coq toplevel

   Dump Universes.
     prints the graph of universes in the form of constraints

   Dump Universes "file".
     produces the "file" containing universe constraints in the form
       univ1 # univ2 ;
     where # can be either > >= or =
     
   The file produced by the latter command can be transformed using
   the script univdot to dot format.
   For example

   univdot file | dot -Tps > file.ps

   produces a graph of universes in ps format. 
   > arrows are red, >= blue, and = black.


   *) for dot see http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/


2. There is a printing option
  
   Termast.print_universes : bool ref

   which, when set (in ocaml after Drop), makes all pretty-printed
   Type's annotated with the name of the universe.
