There were otherwise several bugs in beta-releases, from memory, bugs with beta versions of primitive projections or template polymorphism or native compilation or guard (e7fc96366, 2a4d714a1).

There were otherwise maybe unexploitable kernel bugs, e.g. 2df88d83 (Require overloading), 0adf0838 ("Univs: uncovered bug in strengthening of opaque polymorphic definitions."), 5122a398 (#3746 about functors), #4346 (casts in VM), a14bef4 (guard condition in 8.1), 6ed40a8 ("Georges' bug" with ill-typed lazy machine), and various other bugs in 8.0 or 8.1 w/o knowing if they are critical.
