  exploit: test-suite/misc/poly-capture-global-univs
  GH issue number: #8341
  risk: unlikely to be activated by chance (requires a plugin)

  component: template polymorphism
  summary: template polymorphism not collecting side constrains on the
  universe level of a parameter; this is a general form of the
  previous issue about template polymorphism exploiting other ways to
  generate untracked constraints
  introduced: morally at the introduction of template polymorphism, 23
  May 2006, 9c2d70b, r8845, Herbelin
  impacted released versions: at least V8.4-V8.4pl6, V8.5-V8.5pl3,
  V8.6-V8.6pl2, V8.7.0-V8.7.1, V8.8.0-V8.8.1, V8.9.0-V8.9.1, in theory
  also V8.1-V8.1pl4, V8.2-V8.2pl2, V8.3-V8.3pl2 but not exploit found
  there yet (an exploit using a plugin to force sharing of universe
  level is in principle possible though)
  impacted development branches: all from 8.4 to 8.9 at the time of writing and suspectingly also all from 8.1 to 8.4 if a way to create untracked constraints can be found
  impacted coqchk versions: a priori all (tested with V8.4 and V8.9 which accept the exploit)
  fixed in: soon in master and V8.10.0 (PR #9918, Aug 2019, Dénès and Sozeau)
  found by: Gilbert using explicit sharing of universes, exploit found for 8.5-8.9 by Pédrot, other variants generating sharing using sections, or using ltac tricks by Sozeau, exploit in 8.4 by Herbelin and Jason Gross by adding new tricks to Sozeau's variants
  exploit: test-suite/failure/Template.v
  GH issue number: #9294
  risk: moderate risk to be activated by chance

  component: template polymorphism
  summary: using the same universe in the parameters and the
  constructor arguments of a template polymorphic inductive (using
  named universes in modern Coq, or unification tricks in older Coq)
  produces implicit equality constraints not caught by the previous
  template polymorphism fix.
  introduced: same as the previous template polymorphism bug, morally
  from V8.1, first verified impacted version V8.5 (the universe
  unification is sufficiently different in V8.4 to prevent our trick
  from working)
  fixed in: expected in 8.10.2, 8.11+beta, master (#11128, Nov 2019, Gilbert)
  found by: Gilbert
  exploit: test-suite/bugs/bug_11039.v
  GH issue number: #11039
  risk: moderate risk (found by investigating #10504)

  component: universe polymorphism, asynchronous proofs

  introduced: between 8.4 and 8.5 by merging the asynchronous proofs feature branch and universe polymorphism one
  impacted released versions: V8.5-V8.10
  impacted development branches: none
  impacted coqchk versions: immune
  fixed in: PR#10664
  found by: Pédrot
  exploit: no test
  GH issue number: none
  risk: unlikely to be triggered in interactive mode, not present in batch mode (i.e. coqc)

  component: algebraic universes
  summary: Set+2 was incorrectly simplified to Set+1
  introduced: V8.10 (with the SProp commit 75508769762372043387c67a9abe94e8f940e80a)
  impacted released versions: V8.10.0 V8.10.1 V8.10.2
  impacted coqchk versions: same
  fixed in: PR#11422
  found by: Gilbert
  exploit: see PR (custom application of Hurkens to get around the refreshing at elaboration)
  GH issue number: see PR
  risk: unlikely to be triggered through the vernacular (the system "refreshes" algebraic
    universes such that +2 increments do not appear), mild risk from plugins which manipulate
    algebraic universes.

  component: cumulative inductives and sections
  summary: variance inference for section universes ignored use of section universes in inductives and axioms defined before the inductive being inferred
  introduced: V8.12 (73c3b874633d6f6f8af831d4a37d0c1ae52575bc)
  impacted released versions: V8.12 to V8.15 including patch releases
  impacted coqchk versions: none
  fixed in: V8.16 PR#15950 (118ffbc010ce53ebd45baa42edd28335301ca9a5)
  found by: Gilbert and Pédrot
  exploit: see #15916
  risk: could be used inadvertently in developments with complex universe usage, only when using cumulative inductives declared in sections. coqchk still works.

  component: primitive projections, guard condition
  summary: check of guardedness of extra arguments of primitive projections missing
  introduced: 6 May 2014, a4043608f, Sozeau
  impacted released versions: V8.5-V8.5pl2, 
  impacted development branches: none
  impacted coqchk versions: ?
  fixed in: trunk/master/v8.5 (ba00867d5, 25 Jul 2016, Sozeau)
  found by: Sozeau, by analyzing bug report #4876
  exploit: to be done (?)
  GH issue number: #4876
  risk: consequence of bug found by chance, unlikely to be exploited by chance (MS?)

  component: primitive projections, guard condition
  summary: records based on primitive projections became possibly recursive without the guard condition being updated

  component: all 3 kernel conversion machines (lazy, VM, native), primitive arrays
  summary: conversion would compare the mutated version of primitive arrays instead of undoing mutation where needed
  introduced: V8.13
  impacted released versions: V8.13 to V8.16.0
  impacted coqchk versions: same
  fixed in: V8.16.1, V8.17
  found by: Maxime Buyse and Andres Erbsen
  exploit: Andres Erbsen
  GH issue number: #16829
  risk: some if using primitive arrays

  component: "virtual" reduction machine
  summary: tactic code could mutate a global cache of values for section variables
  introduced: V8.1
  impacted released versions: V8.1-V8.16.1
  impacted coqchk versions: none (no tactics in coqchk, VM only sees checked terms)
  fixed in: V8.17.0
  found by: Gaëtan Gilbert with hint from Pierre-Marie Pédrot
  GH issue number: #16957
  risk: the full exploitation seems to require "Definition := ltac:()"
        with change_no_check on a section variable in the ltac

  component: VM machine
  summary: incorrect handling of universe polymorphism
  introduced: V8.5
  impacted released versions: V8.5-V8.8.0
  impacted coqchk versions: none (no VM in coqchk)
  fixed in: V8.8.1, V8.9.0
  found by: Jason Gross
  GH issue number: #7723
  exploit: see issue
  risk: ??

Side-effects

  component: side-effects
  summary: polymorphic side-effects inside monomorphic definitions incorrectly handled as not inlined
  introduced: ?
  impacted released versions: at least from 8.6 to 8.12.0
  impacted coqchk versions: none (no side-effects in the checker)
  found by: ppedrot
  exploit: test-suite/bugs/bug_13330.v
  GH issue number: #13330
  risk: unlikely to be exploited by mistake, requires the use of unsafe tactics

Forgetting unsafe flags

  component: sections
  summary: unsafe typing flags used inside a section would not be reported by Print Assumptions
           after closing the section
  introduced: abab878b8d8b5ca85a4da688abed68518f0b17bd (#10291, 8.11)
              technically available earlier through plugins
  impacted coqchk versions: none (coqchk rejects affected files)
  found by: Anton Trunov
  GH issue number: #14317
  risk: low as it needs the use of explicit unsafe flags 

Conflicts with axioms in library

  component: library of real numbers
  summary: axiom of description and decidability of equality on real numbers in library Reals was inconsistent with impredicative Set
  introduced: 67c75fa01, 20 Jun 2002
  impacted released versions: 7.3.1, 7.4
  impacted coqchk versions: 
  fixed by deciding to drop impredicativity of Set: bac707973, 28 Oct 2004
  found by: Herbelin & Werner
  exploit: need to find the example again
  GH issue number: no
  risk: unlikely to be exploited by chance

  component: library of extensional sets, guard condition
  summary: guard condition was unknown to be inconsistent with propositional extensionality in library Sets
  introduced: not a bug per se but an incompatibility discovered late
  impacted released versions: technically speaking from V6.1 with the introduction of the Sets library which was then inconsistent from the very beginning without we knew it
  impacted coqchk versions: ?
  fixed by constraining the guard condition: (9b272a8, ccd7546c 28 Oct 2014, Barras, Dénès)
  found by: Schepler, Dénès, Azevedo de Amorim
  exploit: ?
  GH issue number: none
  risk: unlikely to be exploited by chance (?)

  component: library for axiom of choice and excluded-middle
  summary: incompatibility axiom of choice and excluded-middle with elimination of large singletons to Set
  introduced: not a bug but a change of intended "model"
  impacted released versions: strictly before 8.1
  impacted coqchk versions: ?
  fixed by constraining singleton elimination: b19397ed8, r9633, 9 Feb 2007, Herbelin
  found by: Benjamin Werner

  component: primitive floating-points
  summary: Incorrect specification of PrimFloat.leb
  introduced: 8.11
  impacted released versions: 8.11.0, 8.11.1, 8.11.2
  fixed by fixing the spec: #12484
  found by: Pierre Roux
  exploit: test-suite/bugs/bug_12483.v 
  GH issue number: #12483
  risk: proof of false when using the incorrect axiom

  component: floating-point library
  summary: Incorrect implementation of SFclassify.
  introduced: 8.11
  impacted released versions: 8.11.0-8.15.1
  fixed by fixing the implementation: #16101
  found by: François Bobot
  exploit: test-suite/bugs/bug_16096.v
  GH_issue_number: #16096
  risk: proof of false when using the axioms in Floats.Axioms.

  component: primitive floating-points + "native" conversion machine (translation to OCaml which compiles to native code)
  summary: nativenorm reading back closures as arbitrary floating-point values
  introduced: 8.11
  impacted released versions: 8.11.0-8.17.1
  impacted coqchk versions: none (no native computation in coqchk)
  fixed in: 8.18.0
  found by: Jason Gross
  GH issue number: #17871
  risk: proof of false when using primitive floats and native_compute

Deserialization

  component: coqchk (coqc trusts that .vo files are well formed)
  summary: deserialization of .vo data not properly checked
  introduced: 8.16 (univ levels), 8.10 (retroknowledge)
  impacted released versions: 8.10-8.18.1
  impacted coqchk versions: same
  fixed in: 8.19
  found by: Mario Carneiro
  GH issue number: N/A (fix pull requests: #18403, #18406)
  risk: can lead to segfaults or arbitrary code execution on crafted .vo files
    (files produced by coqc are fine)

There were otherwise several bugs in beta-releases, from memory, bugs with beta versions of primitive projections or template polymorphism or native compilation or guard (e7fc96366, 2a4d714a1).

There were otherwise maybe unexploitable kernel bugs, e.g. 2df88d83 (Require overloading), 0adf0838 ("Univs: uncovered bug in strengthening of opaque polymorphic definitions."), 5122a398 (#3746 about functors), #4346 (casts in VM), a14bef4 (guard condition in 8.1), 6ed40a8 ("Georges' bug" with ill-typed lazy machine), and various other bugs in 8.0 or 8.1 w/o knowing if they are critical.

Another non exploitable bug?

  summary: bug in 31bit arithmetic
  introduced: V8.1
  impacted released versions: none
  impacted development branches:
