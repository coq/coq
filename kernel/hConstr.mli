type t
(** Hashconsed constr in an implicit environment,
    keeping variables which have different types and bodies separate.

    For instance the [x] subterms in [fun x : bool => x] and [fun x : nat => x] are different
    (and have different hashes modulo accidental collision)
    and the [x] subterms in [fun (y:nat) (x:bool) => x] and [fun (x:bool) (y:nat) => x] are different
    (one is [Rel 1], the other is [Rel 2])
    but the [x] subterms in [fun (y:nat) (x:bool) => x] and [fun (y:bool) (x:bool) => x] are shared.

    This allows using it as a cache key while typechecking.

    Hashconsing information of subterms is also kept. *)
