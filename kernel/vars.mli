(** The type [substl] is the type of substitutions [u₁..un] of type
    some well-typed context Δ and defined in some environment Γ.
    Typing of substitutions is defined by:
    - Γ ⊢ ∅ : ∅,
    - Γ ⊢ u₁..u{_n-1} : Δ and Γ ⊢ u{_n} : An\[u₁..u{_n-1}\] implies
      Γ ⊢ u₁..u{_n} : Δ,x{_n}:A{_n}
    - Γ ⊢ u₁..u{_n-1} : Δ and Γ ⊢ un : A{_n}\[u₁..u{_n-1}\] implies
      Γ ⊢ u₁..u{_n} : Δ,x{_n}:=c{_n}:A{_n} when Γ ⊢ u{_n} ≡ c{_n}\[u₁..u{_n-1}\]

    Note that [u₁..un] is represented as a list with [un] at the head of
    the list, i.e. as [[un;...;u₁]].

    A [substl] differs from an [instance] in that it includes the
    terms bound by lets while the latter does not. Also, their
    internal representations are in opposite order. *)

type substl = constr list

(** The type [instance] is the type of instances [u₁..un] of a
    well-typed context Δ (relatively to some environment Γ). Typing of
    instances is defined by:
    - Γ ⊢ ∅ : ∅,
    - Γ ⊢ u₁..u{_n} : Δ and Γ ⊢ u{_n+1} : A{_n+1}\[ϕ(Δ,u₁..u{_n})\] implies
      Γ ⊢ u₁..u{_n+1} : Δ,x{_n+1}:A{_n+1}
    - Γ ⊢ u₁..u{_n} : Δ implies
      Γ ⊢ u₁..u{_n} : Δ,x{_n+1}:=c{_n+1}:A{_n+1}
    where [ϕ(Δ,u₁..u{_n})] is the substitution obtained by adding lets
    of Δ to the instance so as to get a substitution (see
    [subst_of_rel_context_instance] below).

    Note that [u₁..un] is represented as an array with [u1] at the
    head of the array, i.e. as [[u₁;...;un]]. In particular, it can
    directly be used with [mkApp] to build an applicative term
    [f u₁..un] whenever [f] is of some type [forall Δ, T].

    An [instance] differs from a [substl] in that it does not include
    the terms bound by lets while the latter does. Also, their
    internal representations are in opposite order.

    An [instance_list] is the same as an [instance] but using a list
    instead of an array. *)

type instance_list = constr list

(** Let [Γ] be a context interleaving declarations [x₁:T₁..xn:Tn]
   and definitions [y₁:=c₁..yp:=cp] in some context [Γ₀]. Let
   [u₁..un] be an {e instance} of [Γ], i.e. an instance in [Γ₀]
   of the [xi]. Then, [subst_of_rel_context_instance_list Γ u₁..un]
   returns the corresponding {e substitution} of [Γ], i.e. the
   appropriate interleaving [σ] of the [u₁..un] with the [c₁..cp],
   all of them in [Γ₀], so that a derivation [Γ₀, Γ, Γ₁|- t:T]
   can be instantiated into a derivation [Γ₀, Γ₁ |- t[σ]:T[σ]] using
   [substnl σ |Γ₁| t].
   Note that the instance [u₁..un] is represented starting with [u₁],
   as if usable in [applist] while the substitution is
   represented the other way round, i.e. ending with either [u₁] or
   [c₁], as if usable for [substl]. *)
