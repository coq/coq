(** [fast_compare_neq] : is [arcv] in the transitive upward closure of [arcu] ?

  In [strict] mode, we fully distinguish between LE and LT, while in
  non-strict mode, we simply answer LE for both situations.

  If [arcv] is encountered in a LT part, we could directly answer
  without visiting unneeded parts of this transitive closure.
  In [strict] mode, if [arcv] is encountered in a LE part, we could only
  change the default answer (1st arg [c]) from NLE to LE, since a strict
  constraint may appear later. During the recursive traversal,
  [lt_done] and [le_done] are universes we have already visited,
  they do not contain [arcv]. The 4rd arg is [(lt_todo,le_todo)],
  two lists of universes not yet considered, known to be above [arcu],
  strictly or not.

  We use depth-first search, but the presence of [arcv] in [new_lt]
  is checked as soon as possible : this seems to be slightly faster
  on a test.

  We do the traversal imperatively, setting the [status] flag on visited nodes.
  This ensures O(1) check, but it also requires unsetting the flag when leaving
  the function. Some special care has to be taken in order to ensure we do not
  recover a messed up graph at the end. This occurs in particular when the
  traversal raises an exception. Even though the code below is exception-free,
  OCaml may still raise random exceptions, essentially fatal exceptions or
  signal handlers. Therefore we ensure the cleanup by a catch-all clause. Note
  also that the use of an imperative solution does make this function
  thread-unsafe. For now we do not check universes in different threads, but if
  ever this is to be done, we would need some lock somewhere.
