    The 3 important cases are :
     - Const _ where we need to first unfold the constant and return
       the needed assumptions of its body in the environment,
     - Rel _ which means the term is a variable which has been bound
       earlier by a Lambda or a Prod (returns [] ),
     - Var _ which means that the term refers to a section variable or
       a "Let" definition, in the former it is an assumption of [t],
       in the latter is must be unfolded like a Const.
    The other cases are straightforward recursion.
    Calls to the environment are memoized, thus avoiding exploration of
    the DAG of the environment as if it was a tree (can cause
    exponential behavior and prevent the algorithm from terminating
    in reasonable time). [s] is a set of [context_object], representing
