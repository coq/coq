(** [Libobject] declares persistent objects, given with methods:

   * a caching function specifying how to add the object in the current
     scope; called when the object is added and after the end of the containing
     sections.
     If the object wishes to register its visibility in the Nametab,
     it should do so for all possible suffixes.

   * a loading function, specifying what to do when the module
     containing the object is loaded; called at Require
     and after the end of the containing modules.
     If the object wishes to register its visibility in the Nametab,
     it should do so for all suffixes no shorter than the "int" argument

   * an opening function, specifying what to do when the module
     containing the object is opened; called when the containing modules
     are Imported.
     Objects which should only have an effect when the nearest containing module
     is imported (and not when the modules containing the nearest module are imported)
     must check that the "int" argument is [1].
     If the object wishes to register its visibility in the Nametab,
     it should do so for the suffix of the length the "int" argument

   * a classification function, specifying what to do with the object,
     when the current module (containing the object) is ended;
     The possibilities are:
     Dispose    - the object is dropped at the end of the module.
     Substitute - the object is kept at the end of the module.
       When the module is cloned (Include, module aliases)
       or when it's a module type which is getting instantiated
       (eg if module type [T] is used for a functor argument [X : T]
        or [Declare Module X : T]),
       the substitution function is called on the object to update the module name.
     Keep       - the object is kept at the end of the module.
       When the module is cloned the object is not cloned with it.
       Keep objects in a module type or functor are still in effect outside it.
     Anticipate - this is for objects that have to be explicitly managed
       by the [end_module] function (currently only Require).

   * a substitution function, performing the substitution;
     this function should be declared for substitutive objects
     only (see above). NB: the substitution might be delayed
     instead of happening at module creation, so this function
     should _not_ depend on the current environment

   * a discharge function, that is called at section closing time to
     collect the data necessary to rebuild the discharged form of the
     non volatile objects. If it returns [None] the object is dropped.
     It is called in the state inside the section at its end, before it is reset.
     Notably the global environment contains the section data and the non-discharged globals.

   * a rebuild function, that is applied after section closing to
     rebuild the non volatile content of a section from the data
     collected by the discharge function
     It is called in the state after the end of the section with any previous objects already present.
     Notably the global environment contains the discharged globals.

  Any type defined as a persistent object must be pure (e.g. no references) and
  marshallable by the OCaml Marshal module (e.g. no closures).

    [locality] not the rest of the object.

    It is up to the caller of [add_leaf] to produce sensible errors if
    a value which cannot be discharged is given with non Local
    locality.

    If [subst] is [None] non [Local] values are [Keep], otherwise [Substitute].

    [Export] values are only imported with shallow imports (depth = 1).

    [cat] only matters when importing, ie only for [Export] values.

  (locality * 'a, locality * 'a, locality * 'a) object_declaration

(** Higher-level API for objects with fixed scope.

- Local means that the object cannot be imported from outside.
- Global means that it can be imported (by importing the module that contains the
object).
- Superglobal means that the object survives to closing a module, and is imported
when the file which contains it is Required (even without Import).
- With the nodischarge variants, the object does not survive section closing.
  With the normal variants, it does.

We recommend to avoid declaring superglobal objects and using the nodischarge
variants.
