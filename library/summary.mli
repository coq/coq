   in synchronization during the various backtracks of the system. *)

(** For tables registered during the launch of coqtop, the [init_function]
    will be run only once, during an [init_summaries] done at the end of
    coqtop initialization. For tables registered later (for instance
    during a plugin dynlink), [init_function] is used when unfreezing
    an earlier frozen state that doesn't contain any value for this table.

    Beware: for tables registered dynamically after the initialization
    of Coq, their init functions may not be run immediately. It is hence
    the responsability of plugins to initialize themselves properly.

val declare_summary : string -> 'a summary_declaration -> unit

(** All-in-one reference declaration + summary registration.
    It behaves just as OCaml's standard [ref] function, except
    that a [declare_summary] is done, with [name] as string.
    The [init_function] restores the reference to its initial value.
    The [freeze_function] can be overridden *)

val ref : ?freeze:(marshallable -> 'a -> 'a) -> name:string -> 'a -> 'a ref

(** Special name for the summary of ML modules.  This summary entry is
    special because its unfreeze may load ML code and hence add summary
    entries.  Thus is has to be recognizable, and handled appropriately *)
