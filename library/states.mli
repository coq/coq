(** {6 States of the system} *)

(** In that module, we provide functions to get
  and set the state of the whole system. Internally, it is done by
  freezing the states of both [Lib] and [Summary]. We provide functions
  to write and restore state to and from a given file. *)

(** [with_state_protection f x] applies [f] to [x] and restores the
