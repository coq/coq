  The Coq development team is pleased to announce the release of Coq
version 7.3. This release offers the following novelties or improvements:

- New option -dump-glob to coqtop to dump globalizations (to be used by the 
  new documentation tool coqdoc; see http://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/coqdoc).
- Elimination to Set/Type from empty propositions and to Type from
  "singleton" propositions now allowed (as a consequence eqT_rec and
  False_rec are now automatically available).
- Tactics:
  - New "Rename x into y" for renaming hypotheses.
  - New "Pose x:=u" and "Pose u" to add definitions to local context.
  - Tactic Definition's without arguments now allowed in Coq states.
  - Inversion has been improved and Intuition simplified but not in a 
    fully compatible way.
- Record's now accept anonymous fields "_" (no projection is built then)
- Haskell extraction now operational.
- Extensions of [ZArith]: Zcomplements.v, Zpower.v and Zlogarithms.v
  have been moved from contrib/omega to ZArith. They now include
  the Zsgn function, more induction principles (Wf_Z.v and
  tail of Zcomplements.v) and one more general Euclid theorem.

  We would also like to thank our users for their new contributions 
(all compatible with Coq V7.3):
  
- CongruenceClosure: Congruence Closure Decision Procedure 
  (Pierre Corbineau, ENS Cachan)
- MapleMode: A Maple Mode for Coq 
  (David Delahaye, Micaela Mayero, Chalmers University)
- Presburger: A formalization of Presburger's algorithm 
  (Laurent Thery, INRIA Sophia Antipolis)
- ZChinese: A proof of the Chinese Lemma (based on ZArith) 
  (Pierre Letouzey, LRI Orsay)

  Most known bugs of version 7.2 are fixed (for the current status of
reported bugs, see http://coq.inria.fr/bin/coq-bugs).

ported to V7.3 yet.
