            INSTALLATION PROCEDURES FOR THE COQ V8.2 SYSTEM
            -----------------------------------------------

WHAT DO YOU NEED ?
==================

   Coq is designed to work on computers equipped with a POSIX (Unix or
   a clone) operating system. It also works under Microsoft Windows
   (see INSTALL.win); for a precompiled MacOS X package, see
   INSTALL.macosx.

   Coq is known to be actively used under GNU/Linux (i386, amd64 and
   ppc) and FreeBSD. Automated tests are run under many, many
   different architectures under GNU/Linux.

   Naturally, Coq will run faster on an architecture where OCaml can
   compile to native code, rather than only bytecode. At time of
   writing, that is IA32, PowerPC, AMD64, Alpha, Sparc, Mips, IA64,
   HPPA and StrongArm. See
   http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/portability.en.html for details.


   Your OS may already contain Coq under the form of a precompiled
   package or ready-to-compile port. In this case, and if the supplied
   version suits you, follow the usual procedure for your OS to
   install it. E.g.:

   - Debian GNU/Linux (or Debian GNU/k*BSD or ...):

     aptitude install coq

   - Gentoo GNU/Linux: emerge sci-mathematics/coq


   Should you need or prefer to compile Coq V8.2 yourself, you need:

     - Objective Caml version 3.07 or later
       (available at http://caml.inria.fr/)

       For Ocaml version >= 3.10.0, you also need to install camlp5
       (version <= 4.08, or 5.01 transitional)
  

     - GNU Make version 3.81 or later
       (
	available at http://www.gnu.org/software/make/, but also a
        standard or optional add-on part to most Unices and Unix
        clones, sometimes under the name "gmake".

	If a new enough version is not included in your system, nor
        easily available as an add-on, this should get you a working
        make:

	#Download it (wget is an example, use your favourite FTP or HTTP client)
	wget http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/make/make-3.81.tar.bz2
	bzip2 -cd make-3.81.tar.bz2 | tar x
	#If you don't have bzip2, you can download the gzipped version instead.
        cd make-3.81
        ./configure --prefix=${HOME}
	make install

	Then, make sure that ${HOME}/bin is first in your $PATH.
       )

     - a C compiler

     - for Coqide, the Lablgtk development files, and the GTK libraries

   By FTP, Coq comes as a single compressed tar-file. You have
   probably already decompressed it if you are reading this document.


QUICK INSTALLATION PROCEDURE.
=============================

1. ./configure
2. make world
3. make install (you may need superuser rights)
4. make clean


INSTALLATION PROCEDURE IN DETAILS (NORMAL USERS).
=================================================

1- Check that you have the Objective Caml compiler version 3.07 (or later)
   installed on your computer and that "ocamlmktop" and "ocamlc" (or
   its native code version "ocamlc.opt") lie in a directory which is present
   in your $PATH environment variable. 

   To get Coq in native-code, (it runs 4 to 10 times faster than
   bytecode, but it takes more time to get compiled and the binary is
   bigger), you will also need the "ocamlopt" (or its native code version
   "ocamlopt.opt") command.

2- Check that you have Camlp4 installed on your 
   computer and that the command "camlp4" lies in a directory which
   is present in your $PATH environment variable path.
   (You need Camlp4 in both bytecode and native versions if
   your platform supports it).

   Note: in the latest ocaml distributions, camlp4 comes with ocaml so
   you do not have to check this point anymore.

3- The uncompression and un-tarring of the distribution file gave birth 
   to a directory named "coq-8.xx". You can rename this directory and put 
   it wherever you want. Just keep in mind that you will need some spare
   space during the compilation (reckon on about 50 Mb of disk space
   for the whole system in native-code compilation). Once installed, the
   binaries take about 14 Mb, and the library about 9 Mb.

4- First you need to configure the system. It is done automatically with
   the command:

	./configure <options>

   The "configure" script will ask you for directories where to put
   the Coq binaries, standard library, man pages, etc. It will propose
   you some default values.

   For a list of options accepted by the "configure" script, run
   "./configure -help". The main options accepted are:

-prefix <dir>
	Binaries, library, man pages and Emacs mode will be respectively
	installed in <dir>/bin, <dir>/lib/coq, <dir>/man and
	<dir>/lib/emacs/site-lisp

-bindir <dir>                   (default: /usr/local/bin)
        Directory where the binaries will be installed

-libdir <dir>                   (default: /usr/local/lib/coq)
        Directory where the Coq standard library will be installed

-mandir <dir>                   (default: /usr/local/man)
        Directory where the Coq manual pages will be installed

-emacslib <dir>			(default: /usr/local/lib/emacs/site-lisp)
	Directory where the Coq Emacs mode will be installed

-arch <value>			(default is the result of the command "arch")
	An arbitrary architecture name for your machine (useful when
	compiling Coq on two different architectures for which the
	result of "arch" is the same, e.g. Sun OS and Solaris)

-local
        Compile Coq to run in its source directory. The installation (step 6)
        is not necessary in that case.

-opt
        Use the ocamlc.opt compiler instead of ocamlc (and ocamlopt.opt 
        compiler instead of ocamlopt). Makes compilation faster (recommended).

-nowarnings
	Disable the Objective Caml compiler warnings. This option has no
	effect on the result of the compilation.

5- Still in the root directory, do

	make world

   to compile Coq in Objective Caml bytecode (and native-code if supported).

   This will compile the entire system. This phase can take more or less time,
   depending on your architecture and is fairly verbose. 

6- You can now install the Coq system. Executables, libraries, manual pages
   and emacs mode are copied in some standard places of your system, defined at
   configuration time (step 3). Just do

	umask 022
       	make install

   Of course, you may need superuser rights to do that.
   To use the Coq emacs mode you also need to put the following lines
   in you .emacs file:

        (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.v$" . coq-mode) auto-mode-alist))
        (autoload 'coq-mode "coq" "Major mode for editing Coq vernacular." t)

7- You can now clean all the sources. (You can even erase them.)

	make clean


INSTALLATION PROCEDURE FOR ADVANCED USERS.
==========================================

   If you wish to write tactics (and that really means that you belong
   to advanced users!) you *must* keep the Coq sources, without cleaning
   them. Therefore, to avoid a duplication of binaries and library, it is
   not necessary to do the installation step (6- above).
   You just have to tell it at configuration step (4- above) with the
   option -local :

	./configure -local <other options>

   Then compile the sources as described in step 5 above. The resulting
   binaries will reside in the subdirectory bin/.

   If you want to compile the sources for debugging (i.e. with the option
   -g of the Caml compiler) then add the -debug option at configuration
   step :

	./configure -debug <other options>

   and then compile the sources (step 5). Then you must make a Coq toplevel
   including your own tactics, which must be compiled with -g, with coqmktop.
   See the chapter 16 of the Coq Reference Manual for details about how
   to use coqmktop and the Objective Caml debugger with Coq.


THE AVAILABLE COMMANDS.
=======================

   There are two Coq commands:
	
	coqtop		The Coq toplevel
	coqc		The Coq compiler

   There are actually two binaries for the interactive system, coqtop.byte
   and coqtop.opt (respectively bytecode and native code versions of Coq). 
   coqtop is a link to the fastest version, i.e. coqtop.opt if any, and
   coqtop.byte otherwise. coqc also invokes the fastest version of Coq.
   Options -opt and -byte to coqtop and coqc selects a particular binary.

    * `coqtop' launches Coq in the interactive mode. The default state
      (see the "-inputstate" option) is `initial.coq', which contains some 
      basic logical definitions, the associated parsing and printing rules,
      and the following tactic modules: Equality, Tauto, Inv, EAuto and Refine.

    * `coqc' allows compilation of Coq files directly from the command line.
      To compile a file foo.v, do:

		coqc foo.v

      It will produce a file foo.vo, that you can now load through the Coq 
      command "Require". 

   A detailed description of these commands and of their options is given
   in the Reference Manual (which you can get by FTP, in the doc/
   directory, or read online on http://coq.inria.fr/doc/)
   and in the corresponding manual pages.

   There is also a tutorial and a FAQ; see http://coq.inria.fr/doc1-eng.html

COMMON PROBLEMS.
================

    * On some sites, when running `./configure', `pwd' returned a 
    path which is not valid from another machine (it may look like 
    "/tmp_mnt/foo/...") and, as a consequence, you won't be able to run
    coqtop or coqc. The solution is to give the correct value, with

	./configure -src <correct path> <other options>

    * The `make install' procedure uses mkdirhier, a program that may
   not be present on certain systems. To fix that, try to replace
   mkdirhier with mkdir -p

COMPILING FOR DIFFERENT ARCHITECTURES.
======================================

   This section explains how to compile Coq for several architecture,
   sharing the same sources. The important fact is that some files are 
   architecture dependent (.cmx, .o and executable  files for instance)
   but others are not (.cmo and .vo). Consequently, you can :

   o  save some time during compilation by not cleaning the architecture
      independent files;

   o  save some space during installation by sharing the Coq standard
      library (which is fully architecture independent).

   So, in order to compile Coq for a new architecture, proceed as follows:

   * Omit step 7 above and clean only the architecture dependent files:
     it is done automatically with the command

		make archclean

   * Configure the system for the new architecture:

		./configure <options>

     You can specify the same directory for the standard library but you
     MUST specify a different directory for the binaries (of course).

   * Compile and install the system as described in steps 5 and 6 above.


MOVING BINARIES OR LIBRARY.
===========================

   If you move the binaries or the library, Coq will be "lost".
   Running "coqtop" would then return an error message of the kind:

	Error during initialization :
	Error: Can't find file initial.coq on loadpath

   If you really have (or want) to move the binaries or the library, then
   you have to indicate their new places to Coq, using the options -bindir (for
   the binaries directory) and -libdir (for the standard library directory) :

	coqtop -bindir <new directory> -libdir <new directory>
