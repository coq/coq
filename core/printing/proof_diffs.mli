(** Computes the diff between the goals of two Proofs and returns
the highlighted lists of hypotheses and conclusions.

If the strings used to display the goal are not lexable (this is believed
unlikely), this routine will generate a Diff_Failure.  This routine may also
raise Diff_Failure under some "impossible" conditions.

If you want to make your call especially bulletproof, catch these
exceptions, print a user-visible message, then recall this routine with
the first argument set to None, which will skip the diff.
