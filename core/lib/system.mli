(** [get_toplevel_path program] builds a complete path to the
   executable denoted by [program]. This involves:

   - locating the directory: we don't rely on PATH as to make calls to
   /foo/bin/coqtop chose the right /foo/bin/coqproofworker

   - adding the proper suffixes: .opt/.byte depending on the current
   mode, + .exe if in windows.

 Note that this function doesn't check that the executable actually
 exists. This is left back to caller, as well as the choice of
 fallback strategy. We could add a fallback strategy here but it is
 better not to as in most cases if this function fails to construct
 the right name you want you execution to fail rather than fall into
 choosing some random binary from the system-wide installation of
 Coq. *)
