(** This modules implements basic manipulations of errors for use
    throughout Coq's code. *)

(** {6 Error handling} *)

val push : exn -> Exninfo.iexn
[@@ocaml.deprecated "please use [Exninfo.capture]"]

(** {6 Generic errors.}

 [Anomaly] is used for system errors and [UserError] for the
   user's ones. *)

val anomaly : ?loc:Loc.t -> ?info:Exninfo.info -> ?label:string -> Pp.t -> 'a
(** Raise an anomaly, with an optional location and an optional
    label identifying the anomaly. *)

val is_anomaly : exn -> bool
(** Check whether a given exception is an anomaly.
    This is mostly provided for compatibility. Please avoid doing specific
    tricks with anomalies thanks to it. See rather [noncritical] below. *)

exception UserError of string option * Pp.t
(** Main error signaling exception. It carries a header plus a pretty printing
    doc *)

val user_err : ?loc:Loc.t -> ?info:Exninfo.info -> ?hdr:string -> Pp.t -> 'a
(** Main error raising primitive. [user_err ?loc ?hdr pp] signals an
    error [pp] with optional header and location [hdr] [loc] *)

exception Timeout

(** [register_handler h] registers [h] as a handler.
    When an expression is printed with [print e], it
    goes through all registered handles (the most
    recent first) until a handle deals with it.

    Handles signal that they don't deal with some exception
    by returning None. Raising any other exception is
    forbidden and will result in an anomaly.

    Exceptions that are considered anomalies should not be
    handled by registered handlers.
*)

val register_handler : (exn -> Pp.t option) -> unit

(** The standard exception printer *)
val print : exn -> Pp.t
val iprint : Exninfo.iexn -> Pp.t

(** Same as [print], except that the "Please report" part of an anomaly
    isn't printed (used in Ltac debugging). *)
val print_no_report : exn -> Pp.t
val iprint_no_report : Exninfo.iexn -> Pp.t

(** Critical exceptions should not be caught and ignored by mistake
    by inner functions during a [vernacinterp]. They should be handled
    only in [Toplevel.do_vernac] (or Ideslave), to be displayed to the user.
    Typical example: [Sys.Break], [Assert_failure], [Anomaly] ...
*)
val noncritical : exn -> bool

(** Register a printer for errors carrying additional information on
   exceptions. This method is fragile and should be considered
   deprecated *)

  :  (Exninfo.info -> Pp.t Loc.located option)
  -> unit
