(* Futures: asynchronous computations.
 *
 * A Future.computation is like a lazy_t but with some extra bells and whistles
 * to deal with eventual delegation to a slave process.
 *
 * One difference with lazy_t is that a future computation that produces
 * and exception can be substituted for another computation of the same type.
 * Moreover a future computation can be delegated to another execution entity
 * that will be allowed to set the result.  Finally future computations can
 * always be marshalled: if they were joined before marshalling, they will
 * hold the computed value (assuming it is itself marshallable), otherwise
 * they will become invalid and accessing them raises a private exception.
 *)

(* Each computation has a unique id that is inherited by each offspring
 * computation (chain, split, map...).  Joined computations lose it.  *)
