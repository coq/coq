(* Module defining the last essential tiles of interactive proofs.
   A proof deals with the focusing commands (including the braces and bullets),
   the shelf (see the [shelve] tactic) and given up goal (see the [give_up]
   tactic). A proof is made of the following:
   - Proofview: a proof is primarily the data of the current view.
     That which is shown to the user (as a remainder, a proofview
     is mainly the logical state of the proof, together with the
     currently focused goals).
   - Focus: a proof has a focus stack: the top of the stack contains
     the context in which to unfocus the current view to a view focused
     with the rest of the stack.
     In addition, this contains, for each of the focus context,  a
     "focus kind" and a "focus condition" (in practice, and for modularity,
     the focus kind is actually stored inside the condition). To unfocus, one
     needs to know the focus kind, and the condition (for instance "no condition" or
     the proof under focused must be complete) must be met.
   - Given up goals: as long as there is a given up goal, the proof is not completed.
     Given up goals cannot be retrieved, the user must go back where the tactic
     [give_up] was run and solve the goal there.
