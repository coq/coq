(** This module provides the functions to declare new
   variables, parameters, constants and inductive types in the global
   environment. It also updates some accessory tables such as [Nametab]
   (name resolution), [Impargs], and [Notations]. *)

(** We provide three main entry points:

  - one-go functions, that will register a constant in one go, suited
   for non-interactive definitions where the term is given.

  - two-phase [start/save] functions which will create an
   interactive proof, allow its modification using tactics, and saving
   when complete.

  - program mode API, that allow to declare a constant with holes, to
   be fullfilled later.

  Note that the API in this file is still in a state of flux, don't
  hesitate to contact the maintainers if you have any question.

  Additionally, this file does contain some low-level functions, marked
  as such; these functions are unstable and should not be used unless you
  already know what they are doing.

(** {2 Program mode API} *)

(** Coq's Program mode support. This mode extends declarations of
   constants and fixpoints with [Program Definition] and [Program
   Fixpoint] to support incremental construction of terms using
   delayed proofs, called "obligations"

    The mode also provides facilities for managing and auto-solving
   sets of obligations.

    The basic code flow of programs/obligations is as follows:

    - [add_definition] / [add_mutual_definitions] are called from the
   respective [Program] vernacular command interpretation; at this
   point the only extra work we do is to prepare the new definition
   [d] using [RetrieveObl], which consists in turning unsolved evars
   into obligations. [d] is not sent to the kernel yet, as it is not
   complete and cannot be typchecked, but saved in a special
   data-structure. Auto-solving of obligations is tried at this stage
   (see below)

   - [next_obligation] will retrieve the next obligation
   ([RetrieveObl] sorts them by topological order) and will try to
   solve it. When all obligations are solved, the original constant
   [d] is grounded and sent to the kernel for addition to the global
   environment. Auto-solving of obligations is also triggered on
   obligation completion.

{2} Solving of obligations: Solved obligations are stored as regular
   global declarations in the global environment, usually with name
   [constant_obligation_number] where [constant] is the original
   [constant] and [number] is the corresponding (internal) number.

   Solving an obligation can trigger a bit of a complex cascaded
   callback path; closing an obligation can indeed allow all other
   obligations to be closed, which in turn may trigged the declaration
   of the original constant. Care must be taken, as this can modify
   [Global.env] in arbitrarily ways. Current code takes some care to
   refresh the [env] in the proper boundaries, but the invariants
   remain delicate.

{2} Saving of obligations: as open obligations use the regular proof
   mode, a `Qed` will call `Lemmas.save_lemma` first. For this reason
   obligations code is split in two: this file, [Obligations], taking
   care of the top-level vernac commands, and [Declare], which is
   called by `Lemmas` to close an obligation proof and eventually to
   declare the top-level [Program]ed constant.
