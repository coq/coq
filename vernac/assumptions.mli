(** Collects all the objects on which a term directly relies, bypassing kernel
    opacity, together with the recursive dependence DAG of objects.

    WARNING: some terms may not make sense in the environment, because they are
    sealed inside opaque modules. Do not try to do anything fancy with those
    terms apart from printing them, otherwise demons may fly out of your nose.

    NOTE: this function was used in the plugin paramcoq (which no longer exists).
