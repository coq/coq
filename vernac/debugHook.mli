(** Ltac debugger interface; clients should register hooks to interact
   with their provided interface. *)

(** The debugger receives requests by calling read_cmd to get Actions.
 Each Action may return one or more responses as Answers by calling submit_answer.
 Many of them return a single Answer or no Answer, but a single step may generate any
 number of Outputs.

 Debugger initialization has the following steps:
 -> Coq sends Answer.Init
 <- IDE sends zero or more initialization requests such as Action.UpdBpts
 <- IDE sends Action.Configd

 Stopping in the debugger generates Answer.Prompt and Answer.Goal messages,
 at which point the IDE will typically call GetStack and GetVars.  When the
 IDE sends with StepIn..Continue, the debugger will execute more code.  At
 that point, Coq won't try to read more messages from the IDE until the
 debugger stops again or exits.
